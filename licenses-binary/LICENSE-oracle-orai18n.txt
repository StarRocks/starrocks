Oracle Free Use Terms and Conditions

	Definitions

	"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to (a)
	a company or organization (each an "Entity") accessing the Programs,
	if use of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an
	individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be
	on behalf of an Entity. "Program(s)" refers to Oracle software
	provided by Oracle pursuant to the following terms and any updates,
	error corrections, and/or Program Documentation provided by
	Oracle. "Program Documentation" refers to Program user manuals and
	Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program
	Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be
	accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation. "Separate Terms" refers to
	separate license terms that are specified in the Program
	Documentation, readmes or notice files and that apply to Separately
	Licensed Technology. "Separately Licensed Technology" refers to Oracle
	or third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and
	not under the terms of this license.

	Separately Licensed Technology

	Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation,
	readmes or notice files in connection with Oracle or third party
	technology provided as or with the Programs. If specified in the
	Program Documentation, readmes or notice files, such technology will
	be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately
	Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way
	by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a
	notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed
	Technology shall be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under
	the terms of this license.

	Source Code for Open Source Software

	For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is
	licensed under an open source license that gives You the right to
	receive the source code for that binary, You can obtain a copy of the
	applicable source code from https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or
	http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If the source code for such
	software was not provided to You with the binary, You can also receive
	a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting a written
	request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source
	Code" section of the latter website.

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not
	provided to You under Separate Terms.

	License Rights and Restrictions

	Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, a nonexclusive,
	nontransferable, limited license to, subject to the conditions stated
	herein, (a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of
	developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications,
	and running the Programs for your own internal business operations;
	and (b) redistribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation,
	under the terms of this License, provided that You do not charge Your
	end users any additional fees for the use of the Programs. You may
	make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary for
	exercising the license rights granted herein and for backup
	purposes. You are granted the right to use the Programs to provide
	third party training in the use of the Programs and associated
	Separately Licensed Technology only if there is express authorization
	of such use by Oracle on the Program's download page or in the Program
	Documentation.

	Your license is contingent on Your compliance with the following conditions:

	    - You include a copy of this license with any distribution by You
	      of the Programs;

	    - You do not remove markings or notices of either Oracle's or a
	      licensor's proprietary rights from the Programs or Program
	      Documentation;

	    - You comply with all U.S. and applicable export control and
	      economic sanctions laws and regulations that govern Your use of
	      the Programs (including technical data);

	    - You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or
	      decompilation of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You
	      nor allow an associated party to do so.

	For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution
	with the Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may
	not be modified, unless such source code is under Separate Terms
	permitting modification.

	Ownership

	Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property
	rights to the Programs.

	Information Collection

	The Programs' installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may
	transmit a limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider
	about those processes to help Oracle understand and optimize
	them. Oracle does not associate the data with personally identifiable
	information. Refer to Oracle's Privacy Policy at
	www.oracle.com/privacy.

	Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability

	THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ORACLE
	FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING
	WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
	FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

	IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ORACLE BE LIABLE TO
	YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
	PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
	RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
	FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
