# the purpose is to use local hadoop configuration first.
# under HADOOP_CONF_DIR(eg. /etc/ecm/hadoop-conf), there are hadoop/hdfs/hbase conf files.
# and by putting HADOOP_CONF_DIR at front of HADOOP_CLASSPATH, local hadoop conf file will be searched & used first.

# local hadoop configuration is usually well-tailored and optimized, we'd better to leverage that.
# for example, if local hdfs has enabled short-circuit read, then we can use short-circuit read and save io time
