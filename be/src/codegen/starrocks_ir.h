#ifdef IR_COMPILE
// For cross compiling to IR, we need functions decorated in specific ways.  For
// functions that we will replace with codegen, we need them not inlined (otherwise
// we can't find the function by name.  For functions where the non-codegen'd version
// is too long for the compiler to inline, we might still want to inline it since
// the codegen'd version is suitable for inling.
// In the non-ir case (g++), we will just default to whatever the compiler thought
// best at that optimization setting.
