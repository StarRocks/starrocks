{"c1": 1001, "c2": "In the context of big data testing with Iceberg and semi-structured data, this string is designed to reach the required file size (around 3KB) while maintaining valid JSON format. Iceberg, as an open table format for huge datasets, supports efficient management of semi-structured data like JSON, Parquet, and Avro. This long text block includes multiple repetitions of core test scenarios: schema evolution (adding/modifying nested fields), partition pruning based on semi-structured subfields, ACID transactions for UPSERT/DELETE operations on semi-structured columns, and predicate pushdown optimization for nested field filtering. The key requirements for Iceberg testing include verifying compatibility with different semi-structured data formats, ensuring performance of nested field queries, and validating data consistency after schema changes. This string is extended with additional content to meet the 3KB size: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Additional lines to reach size: Iceberg table format supports snapshot isolation, time travel, and rollback, which are critical for semi-structured data management in production environments. Testing nested JSON fields in Iceberg requires validating that array and struct types are correctly stored and retrieved, and that schema changes (e.g., adding a new subfield to a struct) do not break existing queries. This long string ensures the JSON file size is approximately 3KB with only two rows of data, adhering to the requirements of c1 as integer and c2 as string. Further text to fill size: The NYC Taxi Trip dataset is a classic example of semi-structured data used for Iceberg testing, with nested structs for trip details and array fields for passenger information. Generating realistic semi-structured data with tools like Faker or Spark DataGenerator helps simulate production workloads and validate Iceberg's performance with large nested datasets. This final section ensures the total size is exactly around 3KB for the JSON file with two rows, c1 (int) and c2 (long string)." }
{"c1": 1002, "c2": "Continuing the semi-structured data testing theme for Iceberg, this second row's c2 string complements the first to maintain the 3KB total file size. Iceberg's core features for semi-structured data include column-level pruning, which optimizes query performance by only reading the required nested fields from Parquet or JSON files. This string includes technical details about Iceberg's metadata management: the .iceberg directory stores table schema, partition information, and snapshot history, which is essential for consistent access to semi-structured data across different compute engines (Spark, Flink, Trino). Additional content to reach size: Testing Iceberg with JSON data requires validating that optional fields (nullable nested structs) are correctly handled, and that data evolution (e.g., changing a string field to a struct) is supported without data loss. This long text block also includes real-world use cases: e-commerce platforms use Iceberg to manage semi-structured customer review data (JSON with nested product attributes and user feedback), and log analytics systems use Iceberg to store semi-structured log data with array fields for event details. Further extensions: The TPCH-H extended dataset with semi-structured fields is widely used for performance testing of Iceberg, simulating large-scale OLAP queries on nested data. This string is extended to ensure the total JSON file size is approximately 3KB, with two rows, c1 as integer (1001 and 1002) and c2 as long string values. Final filler text to meet size requirements: Apache Iceberg's compatibility with semi-structured data formats makes it a popular choice for lakehouse architectures, enabling unified management of structured and semi-structured data in a single table format. This ensures the JSON file has exactly two rows, two columns (c1 int, c2 string), and a total size of around 3KB, suitable for Iceberg semi-structured data testing scenarios."}
