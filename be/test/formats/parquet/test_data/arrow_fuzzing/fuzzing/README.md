# Parquet File Format Fuzz Regression Files

These files contain parquet files, usually invalid, that used to produce
crashes or undesirable behaviour when ingested by the Parquet C++ file reader.
Those files may contain data generated by fuzzers and may therefore be hard
to interpret by humans, but are useful as a fuzzing test corpus and to avoid
regressions.
