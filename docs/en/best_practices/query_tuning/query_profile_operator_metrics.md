# Query Profile Metrics

> Authoritative reference for raw metrics emitted by **StarRocks Query Profile**, grouped by operator.  
> Use it as a glossary; for troubleshooting guidance jump to **query_profile_tuning_recipes.md**.


### Summary Metrics

Basic information about the query execution:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total | The total time consumed by the query, including Planning, Executing, and Profiling phase durations. |
| Query State | Query state, possible states include Finished, Error, and Running. |
| Query ID | Unique identifier for the query. |
| Start Time | Timestamp when the query started. |
| End Time | Timestamp when the query ended. |
| Total | Total duration of the query. |
| Query Type | Type of the query. |
| Query State | Current state of the query. |
| StarRocks Version | Version of StarRocks used. |
| User | User who executed the query. |
| Default Db | Default database used for the query. |
| Sql Statement | SQL statement executed. |
| Variables | Important variables used for the query. |
| NonDefaultSessionVariables | Non-default session variables used for the query. |
| Collect Profile Time | Time taken to collect the profile. |
| IsProfileAsync | Indicates if the profile collection was asynchronous. |


### Planner Metrics

It provides a comprehensive overview of the planner. Typically, if the total time spent on the planner is less than 10ms, it is not a cause for concern.

In certain scenarios, the planner may require more time:
1. Complex queries may necessitate additional time for parsing and optimization to ensure an optimal execution plan.
2. The presence of numerous materialized views can increase the time required for query rewriting.
3. When multiple concurrent queries exhaust system resources and the query queue is utilized, the `Pending` time may be prolonged.
4. Queries involving external tables may incur additional time for communication with the external metadata server.
