## Examples

The following examples is based on this business scenario:

```Plain
-- Create Table: customer
CREATE TABLE customer ( C_CUSTKEY     INTEGER NOT NULL,
                        C_NAME        VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
                        C_ADDRESS     VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
                        C_NATIONKEY   INTEGER NOT NULL,
                        C_PHONE       CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
                        C_ACCTBAL     double   NOT NULL,
                        C_MKTSEGMENT  CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
                        C_COMMENT     VARCHAR(117) NOT NULL,
                        PAD char(1) NOT NULL)
    ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(`c_custkey`)
COMMENT "OLAP"
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`c_custkey`)
PROPERTIES (
"replication_num" = "1",
"storage_format" = "DEFAULT"
);

-- Create MV: customer_mv
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_mv
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(c_custkey)
REFRESH MANUAL
PROPERTIES (
    "replication_num" = "1"
)
AS SELECT
              c_custkey, c_phone, c_acctbal, count(1) as c_count, sum(c_acctbal) as c_sum
   FROM
              customer
   GROUP BY c_custkey, c_phone, c_acctbal;

-- Refresh the MV
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_mv;
```

Example 1: Show a specific materialized view.

```Plain
mysql> SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS WHERE NAME='customer_mv'\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                        id: 10142
                      name: customer_mv
             database_name: test
              refresh_type: MANUAL
                 is_active: true
   last_refresh_start_time: 2023-02-17 10:27:33
last_refresh_finished_time: 2023-02-17 10:27:33
     last_refresh_duration: 0
        last_refresh_state: SUCCESS
             inactive_code: 0
           inactive_reason:
                      text: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `customer_mv`
COMMENT "MATERIALIZED_VIEW"
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`c_custkey`)
REFRESH MANUAL
PROPERTIES (
"replication_num" = "1",
"storage_medium" = "HDD"
)
AS SELECT `customer`.`c_custkey`, `customer`.`c_phone`, `customer`.`c_acctbal`, count(1) AS `c_count`, sum(`customer`.`c_acctbal`) AS `c_sum`
FROM `test`.`customer`
GROUP BY `customer`.`c_custkey`, `customer`.`c_phone`, `customer`.`c_acctbal`;
                      rows: 0
1 row in set (0.11 sec)
```

Example 2: Show materialized views by matching the name.

```Plain
mysql> SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS WHERE NAME LIKE 'customer_mv'\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                        id: 10142
                      name: customer_mv
             database_name: test
              refresh_type: MANUAL
                 is_active: true
   last_refresh_start_time: 2023-02-17 10:27:33
last_refresh_finished_time: 2023-02-17 10:27:33
     last_refresh_duration: 0
        last_refresh_state: SUCCESS
             inactive_code: 0
           inactive_reason:
                      text: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `customer_mv`
COMMENT "MATERIALIZED_VIEW"
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`c_custkey`)
REFRESH MANUAL
PROPERTIES (
"replication_num" = "1",
"storage_medium" = "HDD"
)
AS SELECT `customer`.`c_custkey`, `customer`.`c_phone`, `customer`.`c_acctbal`, count(1) AS `c_count`, sum(`customer`.`c_acctbal`) AS `c_sum`
FROM `test`.`customer`
GROUP BY `customer`.`c_custkey`, `customer`.`c_phone`, `customer`.`c_acctbal`;
                      rows: 0
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```
