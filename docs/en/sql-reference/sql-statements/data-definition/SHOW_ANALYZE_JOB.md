# SHOW ANALYZE JOB

## Description

Views the information and status of custom collection tasks.

By default, StarRocks automatically collects full statistics of a table. It checks for any data updates every 5 minutes. If data change is detected, data collection will be automatically triggered. If you do not want to use automatic full collection, you can set the FE configuration item `enable_collect_full_statistic` to `false` and customize a collection task.

This statement is supported from v2.4.

## Syntax

```SQL
SHOW ANALYZE JOB [WHERE]
```

You can filter results by using the WHERE clause. The statement returns the following columns.

| **Column**   | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Id           | The ID of the collection task.                               |

| Table        | The table name.                                              |
