# UNION

Combines the result of multiple queries.

## Syntax

```sql
query_1 UNION [DISTINCT | ALL] query_2
```

## Parameters

- `DISTINCT` (default): returns only unique rows. UNION is equivalent to UNION DISTINCT.
- `ALL`: combines all rows, including duplicates. Since de-duplication is memory intensive, queries using UNION ALL are faster and less memory-consuming. For better performance, use UNION ALL.

> **NOTE**
>
> Each query statement must return the same number of columns and the columns must have compatible data types.

## Examples

Create tables `select1` and `select2`.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE select1(
    id          INT,
    price       INT
    )
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id);

INSERT INTO select1 VALUES
    (1,2),
    (1,2),
    (2,3),
    (5,6),
    (5,6);

CREATE TABLE select2(
    id          INT,
    price       INT
    )
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id);

INSERT INTO select2 VALUES
    (2,3),
    (3,4),
    (5,6),
    (7,8);
```

Example 1: Return all IDs in the two tables, including duplicates.

```Plaintext
mysql> (select id from select1) union all (select id from select2) order by id;

+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    5 |
|    5 |
|    5 |
|    7 |
+------+
11 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

Example 2: Return all the unique IDs in the two tables. The following two statements are equivalent.

```Plaintext
mysql> (select id from select1) union (select id from select2) order by id;

+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    5 |
|    7 |
+------+
6 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> (select id from select1) union distinct (select id from select2) order by id;
+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    5 |
|    7 |
+------+
5 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

Example 3: Return the first three IDs among all the unique IDs in the two tables. The following two statements are equivalent.

```SQL
mysql> (select id from select1) union distinct (select id from select2)
order by id
limit 3;
++------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
+------+
4 rows in set (0.11 sec)

mysql> select * from (select id from select1 union distinct select id from select2) as t1
order by id
limit 3;
+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
+------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```
