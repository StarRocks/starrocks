# APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_HLL_SKETCH



Returns the approximate value of aggregate function similar to the result of COUNT(DISTINCT col). Like APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(expr).

It is faster than the COUNT and DISTINCT combination and uses a fixed-size memory, so less memory is used for columns of high cardinality.

It is slower than APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(expr) but with higher precision. Which takes advantages of Apache Datasketches.

## Syntax

```Haskell
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_HLL_SKETCH(expr)
