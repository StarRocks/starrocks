# approx_top_k



Returns the top `k` most frequently occurring item values in an `expr` along with their approximate counts.

This function is supported from v3.0.

## Syntax

```Haskell
APPROX_TOP_K(<expr> [ , <k> [ , <counter_num> ] ] )
```

## Arguments

- `expr`: An expression of STRING, BOOLEAN, DATE, DATETIME, or numeric type.
- `k`: An optional INTEGER literal greater than 0. If `k` is not specified, it defaults to `5`. The maximum value is `100000`.
- `counter_num`: An optional INTEGER literal greater than or equal to `k`, The larger the `counter_num` is, the more accurate the result will be. However, this also comes with increased CPU and memory costs.

  - The maximum value is `100000`.
  - If `counter_num` is not specified, it defaults to `max(min(2 * k, 100), 100000)`.

## Returns

Results are returned as an ARRAY of type STRUCT, where each STRUCT contains an `item` field for the value (with its original input type) and a `count` field (of type BIGINT) with the approximate number of occurrences. The array is sorted by `count` descending.

The aggregate function returns the top `k` most frequently occurring item values in an expression expr along with their approximate counts. The error in each count may be up to `2.0 * numRows / counter_num` where `numRows` is the total number of rows. Higher values of `counter_num` provide better accuracy at the cost of increased memory usage. Expressions that have fewer than `counter_num` distinct items will yield exact item counts. Results include `NULL` values as their own item in the results.

## Examples

Use data in the [scores](../Window_function.md#window-function-sample-table) table as an example.
