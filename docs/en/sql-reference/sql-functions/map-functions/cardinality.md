# cardinality

## Description

Returns the number of elements in a MAP value. MAP is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, for example, `{"a":1, "b":2}`. One key-value pair constitutes one element. `{"a":1, "b":2}` contains two elements.

This function is supported from v3.0 onwards. It is the alias of [map_size()](map_size.md).

From version 2.5, StarRocks supports querying complex data types MAP and STRUCT from data lakes. MAP is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, for example, `{"a":1, "b":2}`. One key-value pair constitutes one element, for example, `{"a":1, "b":2}` contains two elements.

You can use external catalogs provided by StarRocks to query MAP and STRUCT data from Apache Hiveâ„¢, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg. You can only query data from ORC and Parquet files. For more information about how to use external catalogs to query external data sources, see [Overview of catalogs](../../../data_source/catalog/catalog_overview.md) and topics related to the required catalog type.

## Syntax

```Haskell
INT cardinality(any_map)
```

## Parameters

`any_map`: the MAP value from which you want to retrieve the number of elements.

## Return value

Returns a value of the INT value.

If the input is NULL, NULL is returned.

If a key or value in the MAP value is NULL, NULL is processed as a normal value.

## Examples

This example uses the Hive table `hive_map`, which contains the following data:

```Plain
select * from hive_map order by col_int;
+---------+---------------+
| col_int | col_map       |
+---------+---------------+
|       1 | {"a":1,"b":2} |
|       2 | {"c":3}       |
|       3 | {"d":4,"e":5} |
+---------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.05 sec)
```

After a [Hive catalog](../../../data_source/catalog/hive_catalog.md#create-a-hive-catalog) is created in your cluster, you can use this catalog and the cardinality() function to obtain the number of elements in each row of the `cardinality` column.

```Plaintext
select cardinality(col_map) from hive_map order by col_int;
+----------------------+
| cardinality(col_map) |
+----------------------+
|                    2 |
|                    1 |
|                    2 |
+----------------------+
3 rows in set (0.05 sec)
```
