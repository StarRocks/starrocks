# Functions

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

StarRocks offers a rich set of functions to facilitate data queries and analysis. In addition to commonly used functions, StarRocks supports semi-structured functions such as ARRAY, JSON, MAP, and STRUCT functions. It also supports higher-order [Lambda functions](Lambda_expression.md). If these functions cannot meet your business requirements, you can use [Java UDF](JAVA_UDF.md) to compile functions. StarRocks also provides [Hive Bitmap UDFs](hive_bitmap_udf.md). You can generate Bitmap data in Hive and then load Bitmap into StarRocks. You can also export the Bitmap data generated in StarRocks to Hive for other systems to use.
