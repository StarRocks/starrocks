# Iceberg Metadata Tables

This topic describes how to inspect the metadata information of Iceberg tables in StarRocks.

## Overview

From V3.4.1 onwards, StarRocks supports Iceberg metadata tables. These metadata tables contain a variety of information about Iceberg tables, such as table change history, snapshots, and manifests. You can query each metadata table by appending the metadata table name to the original table name.

Currently, StarRocks supports the following Iceberg metadata tables:

| Metadata table         | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history`              | Shows a log of metadata changes made to the table.           |
| `metadata_log_entries` | Shows the metadata log entries for the table.                |
| `snapshots`            | Shows details about the table snapshots.                     |
| `manifests`            | Shows an overview of the manifests associated with the snapshots in the tableâ€™s log. |
| `partitions`           | Shows details about the partitions in the table.             |
| `files`                | Shows details about the data files and delete files in the current snapshot of the table. |
| `refs`                 | Shows details about the Iceberg references, including branches and tags. |
