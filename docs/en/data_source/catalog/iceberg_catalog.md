# Iceberg catalog

An Iceberg catalog is a kind of external catalog that enables you to query data from Apache Iceberg without ingestion.

Also, you can directly transform and load data from Iceberg by using [INSERT INTO](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/insert.md) based on Iceberg catalogs. StarRocks supports Iceberg catalogs from v2.4 onwards.

To ensure successful SQL workloads on your Iceberg cluster, your StarRocks cluster needs to integrate with two important components:

- Object storage or distributed file system like AWS S3, other S3-compatible storage system, Microsoft Azure Storage, Google GCS, or HDFS

- Metastore like Hive metastore or AWS Glue

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > If you choose AWS S3 as storage, you can use HMS or AWS Glue as metastore. If you choose any other storage system, you can only use HMS as metastore.

## Usage notes

- The file formats of Iceberg that StarRocks supports are Parquet and ORC:

  - Parquet files support the following compression formats: SNAPPY, LZ4, ZSTD, GZIP, and NO_COMPRESSION.
  - ORC files support the following compression formats: ZLIB, SNAPPY, LZO, LZ4, ZSTD, and NO_COMPRESSION.

- Iceberg catalogs support v1 tables, and support ORC-formatted v2 tables from StarRocks v3.0 onwards.

## Integration preparations

Before you create an Iceberg catalog, make sure your StarRocks cluster can integrate with the storage system and metastore of your Iceberg cluster.

### AWS IAM

If your Iceberg cluster uses AWS S3 as storage or AWS Glue as metastore, choose your suitable authentication method and make the required preparations to ensure that your StarRocks cluster can access the related AWS cloud resources.

The following authentication methods are recommended:

- Instance profile
- Assumed role
- IAM user

Of the above-mentioned three authentication methods, instance profile is the most widely used.

For more information, see [Preparation for authentication in AWS IAM](../../integrations/authenticate_to_aws_resources.md#preparation-for-authentication-in-aws-iam).

### HDFS

If you choose HDFS as storage, configure your StarRocks cluster as follows:

- (Optional) Set the username that is used to access your HDFS cluster and Hive metastore. By default, StarRocks uses the username of the FE and BE processes to access your HDFS cluster and Hive metastore. You can also set the username by adding `export HADOOP_USER_NAME="<user_name>"` at the beginning of the **fe/conf/hadoop_env.sh** file of each FE and at the beginning of the **be/conf/hadoop_env.sh** file of each BE. After you set the username in these files, restart each FE and each BE to make the parameter settings take effect. You can set only one username for each StarRocks cluster.
- When you query Iceberg data, the FEs and BEs of your StarRocks cluster use the HDFS client to access your HDFS cluster. In most cases, you do not need to configure your StarRocks cluster to achieve that purpose, and StarRocks starts the HDFS client using the default configurations. You need to configure your StarRocks cluster only in the following situations:

  - High availability (HA) is enabled for your HDFS cluster: Add the **hdfs-site.xml** file of your HDFS cluster to the **$FE_HOME/conf** path of each FE and to the **$BE_HOME/conf** path of each BE.
  - View File System (ViewFs) is enabled for your HDFS cluster: Add the **core-site.xml** file of your HDFS cluster to the **$FE_HOME/conf** path of each FE and to the **$BE_HOME/conf** path of each BE.

> **NOTE**
>
> If an error indicating an unknown host is returned when you send a query, you must add the mapping between the host names and IP addresses of your HDFS cluster nodes to the **/etc/hosts** path.

### Kerberos authentication

If Kerberos authentication is enabled for your HDFS cluster or Hive metastore, configure your StarRocks cluster as follows:

- Run the `kinit -kt keytab_path principal` command on each FE and each BE to obtain Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from Key Distribution Center (KDC). To run this command, you must have the permissions to access your HDFS cluster and Hive metastore. Note that accessing KDC with this command is time-sensitive. Therefore, you need to use cron to run this command periodically.
- Add `JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.security.krb5.conf=/etc/krb5.conf"` to the **$FE_HOME/conf/fe.conf** file of each FE and to the **$BE_HOME/conf/be.conf** file of each BE. In this example, `/etc/krb5.conf` is the save path of the **krb5.conf** file. You can modify the path based on your needs.

## Create an Iceberg catalog

### Syntax

```SQL
CREATE EXTERNAL CATALOG <catalog_name>
[COMMENT <comment>]
PROPERTIES
(
    "type" = "iceberg",
    MetastoreParams,
    StorageCredentialParams
)
```

### Parameters

#### catalog_name

The name of the Iceberg catalog. The naming conventions are as follows:

- The name can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores (_). It must start with a letter.
- The name is case-sensitive and cannot exceed 1023 characters in length.

#### comment

The description of the Iceberg catalog. This parameter is optional.

#### type

The type of your data source. Set the value to `iceberg`.

#### MetastoreParams

A set of parameters about how StarRocks integrates with the metastore of your data source.

    ```

## View Iceberg catalogs

You can use [SHOW CATALOGS](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_CATALOGS.md) to query all catalogs in the current StarRocks cluster:

```SQL
SHOW CATALOGS;
```

You can also use [SHOW CREATE CATALOG](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_CREATE_CATALOG.md) to query the creation statement of an external catalog. The following example queries the creation statement of an Iceberg catalog named `iceberg_catalog_glue`:

```SQL
SHOW CREATE CATALOG iceberg_catalog_glue;
```

## Switch to an Iceberg Catalog and a database in it

You can use one of the following methods to switch to an Iceberg catalog and a database in it:

- Use [SET CATALOG](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/SET_CATALOG.md) to specify an Iceberg catalog in the current session, and then use [USE](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/USE.md) to specify an active database:

  ```SQL
  -- Switch to a specified catalog in the current session:
  SET CATALOG <catalog_name>
  -- Specify the active database in the current session:
  USE <db_name>
  ```

- Directly use [USE](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/USE.md) to switch to an Iceberg catalog and a database in it:

  ```SQL
  USE <catalog_name>.<db_name>
  ```

## Drop an Iceberg catalog

You can use [DROP CATALOG](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/DROP_CATALOG.md) to drop an external catalog.

The following example drops an Iceberg catalog named `iceberg_catalog_glue`:

```SQL
DROP Catalog iceberg_catalog_glue;
```

## View the schema of an Iceberg table

You can use one of the following syntaxes to view the schema of an Iceberg table:

- View schema

  ```SQL
  DESC[RIBE] <catalog_name>.<database_name>.<table_name>
  ```

- View schema and location from the CREATE statement

  ```SQL
  SHOW CREATE TABLE <catalog_name>.<database_name>.<table_name>
  ```

## Query an Iceberg table

1. Use [SHOW DATABASES](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_DATABASES.md) to view the databases in your Iceberg cluster:

   ```SQL
   SHOW DATABASES FROM <catalog_name>
   ```

2. [Switch to an Iceberg catalog and a database in it](#switch-to-an-iceberg-catalog-and-a-database-in-it).

3. Use [SELECT](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SELECT.md) to query the destination table in the specified database:

   ```SQL
   SELECT count(*) FROM <table_name> LIMIT 10
   ```

## Load data from Iceberg

Suppose you have an OLAP table named `olap_tbl`, you can transform and load data like below:

```SQL
INSERT INTO default_catalog.olap_db.olap_tbl SELECT * FROM iceberg_table
```
