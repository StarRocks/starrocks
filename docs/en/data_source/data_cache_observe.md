# Data Cache observability

In earlier versions, there are no rich metrics or efficient methods to monitor the performance, usage, and health of [Data Cache](./data_cache.md).

In v3.3, StarRocks improves the observability of Data Cache by offering efficient monitoring methods and more metrics. Users can now check the overall disk and memory usage of the data cache, and related metrics, enhancing monitoring of cache usage.

## SQL commands

You can run SQL commands to view the capacity and usage of Data Cache on each BE node.

### SHOW BACKENDS

The `DataCacheMetrics` field records the used disk and memory space of Data Cache on a specific BE.

```SQL

### information_schema

The `be_datacache_metrics` view in `information_schema` records the following Data Cache-related information.

```Bash
mysql> select * from information_schema.be_datacache_metrics;
+-------+--------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| BE_ID | STATUS | DISK_QUOTA_BYTES | DISK_USED_BYTES | MEM_QUOTA_BYTES | MEM_USED_BYTES | META_USED_BYTES | DIR_SPACES                                                                                   |

1 row in set (5.41 sec)
```

- `BE_ID`: the BE ID
- `STATUS`: the BE status
- `DISK_QUOTA_BYTES`: the disk cache capacity configured by users, in bytes
- `DISK_USED_BYTES`: the disk cache space that has been used, in bytes
- `MEM_QUOTA_BYTES`: the memory cache capacity configured by users, in bytes
- `MEM_USED_BYTES`: the memory cache space that has been used, in bytes
- `META_USED_BYTES`: the space used to cache metadata
- `DIR_SPACES`: the cache path and its cache size

## API call

### Method

You can call the following API to view detailed metrics of Data Cache on a BE node.

```Bash
http://${BE_HOST}:${BE_HTTP_PORT}/api/datacache/stat
```

The following figure shows the returned metrics.
