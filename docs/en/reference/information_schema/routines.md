| ROUTINE_SCHEMA       | The name of the database to which the routine belongs.       |
| ROUTINE_NAME         | The name of the routine.                                     |
| ROUTINE_TYPE         | `PROCEDURE` for stored procedures, `FUNCTION` for stored functions. |
| DTD_IDENTIFIER       | If the routine is a stored function, the return value data type. If the routine is a stored procedure, this value is empty. |

| ROUTINE_DEFINITION   | The text of the SQL statement executed by the routine.       |

| EXTERNAL_LANGUAGE    | The language of the stored routine.                          |
| PARAMETER_STYLE      | This value is always `SQL`.                                  |
| IS_DETERMINISTIC     | `YES` or `NO`, depending on whether the routine is defined with the `DETERMINISTIC` characteristic. |
| SQL_DATA_ACCESS      | The data access characteristic for the routine. The value is one of `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO SQL`, `READS SQL DATA`, or `MODIFIES SQL DATA`. |
| SQL_PATH             | This value is always `NULL`.                                 |
