### Metrics for asynchronous materialized views

From v3.1 onwards, StarRocks supports metrics for asynchronous materialized views.

To allow Prometheus to access the materialized view metadata in your cluster, you must add the following configurations in the Prometheus configuration file **prometheus/prometheus.yml**:

```YAML
global:
....
scrape_configs:

  - job_name: 'dev' 
    metrics_path: '/metrics'    
    # Add the following configurations.
    basic_auth:
      username: 'root'
      password: ''
    params:
      'with_materialized_view_metrics' : ['all']   
....
```

- `username`: The username used to log into your StarRocks cluster. This user must be granted the `user_admin` role.
- `password`: The password used to log into your StarRocks cluster.
- `'with_materialized_view_metrics'`: The scope of the metrics to collect. Valid values:
  - `'all'`: All metrics relevant to materialized views are collected.
  - `'minified'`: Gauge metrics and metrics whose values are `0` will not be collected.
