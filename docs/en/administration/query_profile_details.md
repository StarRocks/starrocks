# Query Profile Structure and Metrics

## Structure of Query Profile

The structure of a Query Profile is closely related to the design of StarRocks' execution engine and consists of the following five parts:

- **Fragment**: Execution tree. A query is composed of one or more fragments.
- **FragmentInstance**: Each fragment can have multiple instances, each instance is called a FragmentInstance, and is executed by different computing nodes.
- **Pipeline**: A FragmentInstance is split into multiple pipelines. A pipeline is an execution chain consisting of a group of connected Operator instances.
- **PipelineDriver**: A Pipeline can have multiple instances, each instance is called a PipelineDriver, to fully utilize multiple computing cores.
- **Operator**: A PipelineDriver consists of multiple Operator instances.

### Query Profile Merging Strategy

By analyzing the structure of Query Profile, you can easily observe that multiple FragmentInstances associated with the same Fragment have a high degree of similarity in structure. Similarly, multiple PipelineDrivers belonging to the same Pipeline also exhibit similar structural features. To reduce the volume of the Query Profile, StarRocks by default merges the FragmentInstance layer and the PipelineDriver layer. As a result, the original five-layer structure is simplified to three layers:

- Fragment
- Pipeline
- Operator

You can control this merging behavior through a session variable `pipeline_profile_level`, which has two valid values:

- `1` (Default): StarRocks merges the metrics into a three-layer structure.
- `2`: StarRocks does not merge the metrics. The original five-layer structure is retained.
- Any other value will be treated as the default value `1`.

Generally, we do not recommend setting this parameter to `2` because the Query Profile with the five-layer structure has many limitations. For example, you cannot perform visualized analysis on the profile using any tools. Therefore, unless the merging process leads to the loss of crucial information, you do not need to adjust this parameter.

### Metric Merging and MIN/MAX Values

When merging FragmentInstance and PipelineDriver, all metrics with the same name are merged. Only the minimum and maximum values of each metric in all concurrent instances are recorded. Different types of metrics use different merging strategies:

- Time-related metrics take the average. For example:
  - `OperatorTotalTime` is the average time consumption of all concurrent instances.
  - `__MAX_OF_OperatorTotalTime` is the maximum time consumption among all concurrent instances.
  - `__MIN_OF_OperatorTotalTime` is the minimum time consumption among all concurrent instances.

```SQL
             - OperatorTotalTime: 2.192us
               - __MAX_OF_OperatorTotalTime: 2.502us
               - __MIN_OF_OperatorTotalTime: 1.882us
```

- Non-time-related metrics are summed. For example:
  - `PullChunkNum` is the sum of this metric in all concurrent instances.
  - `__MAX_OF_PullChunkNum` is the maximum value of this metric among all concurrent instances.
  - `__MIN_OF_PullChunkNum` is the minimum value of this metric among all concurrent instances.

```SQL
             - PullChunkNum: 146.66K (146660)
               - __MAX_OF_PullChunkNum: 24.45K (24450)
               - __MIN_OF_PullChunkNum: 24.435K (24435)
```

- Some metrics without extreme values have the same value in all concurrent instances, for example: `DegreeOfParallelism`.

Usually, if there is a significant difference between MIN and MAX values, it indicates a high probability of data skew. Possible scenarios include aggregation and join operations.

```SQL
             - OperatorTotalTime: 2m48s
               - __MAX_OF_OperatorTotalTime: 10m30s
               - __MIN_OF_OperatorTotalTime: 279.170us
```

## Query Profile Metrics List

The Query Profile includes a multitude of metrics providing detailed information about query execution. In most cases, you only need to focus on the execution time of operators and the size of processed data. Once you identify bottlenecks, you can address them specifically.

### Summary Metrics

##### Total

Description: The total time consumed by the query, including Planning, Executing, and Profiling phase durations.

##### QueryCumulativeScanTime

Description: Maximum ScheduleTime metric across all Pipelines.

##### QuerySpillBytes

##### ResultDeliverTime

Description: Additional time to transfer results. For query statements, this parameter refers to the time it takes to send data back to the client; for insert statements, it refers to the time it takes to write data to the storage layer.

### Fragment Metrics

Description: Number of all FragmentInstances for this Fragment.

##### InstanceIds

Description: IDs of all FragmentInstances for this Fragment.

##### BackendNum

Description: Number of BEs participating in the execution of this Fragment.

- ActiveTime = ∑ OperatorTotalTime + OverheadTime
- PendingTime = InputEmptyTime + OutputFullTime + PreconditionBlockTime + PendingFinishTime
- InputEmptyTime = FirstInputEmptyTime + FollowupInputEmptyTime

![profile_pipeline_time_relationship](../assets/Profile/profile_pipeline_time_relationship.jpeg)

##### DegreeOfParallelism

##### PendingTime

Description: Time the Pipeline is blocked from being scheduled for various reasons.

##### InputEmptyTime

Description: Time the Pipeline is blocked due to an empty input queue.

##### FirstInputEmptyTime

##### OperatorAllocatedMemoryUsage

##### OperatorPeakMemoryUsage

Description: Peak memory usage by the Operator across all compute nodes. This metric is meaningful for certain materialization operators, such as aggregation, sorting, Join, etc. It is not relevant for operators like Project because memory is allocated by the current operator and released by subsequent operators, making peak memory equivalent to cumulative allocated memory for the current operator. In versions earlier than v3.1.8 and v3.2.3, this metric represents the peak memory usage by the Operator across all *PipelineDrivers*.

##### PrepareTime

Description: Time spent on preparation.

##### OperatorTotalTime
