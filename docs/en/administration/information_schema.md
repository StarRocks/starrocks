# Information Schema

The StarRocks `information_schema` is a database within each StarRocks instance. `information_schema` contains several read-only, system-defined tables which store extensive metadata information of all objects that the StarRocks instance maintains.

From v3.2 onwards, StarRocks supports viewing external catalog metadata via `information_schema`.

## View metadata via Information Schema

You can view the metadata information within a StarRocks instance by querying the content of tables in `information_schema`.

The following example views metadata information about a table named `sr_member` in StarRocks by querying the table `tables`.

```Plain
mysql> SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE TABLE_NAME like 'sr_member'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  TABLE_CATALOG: def
   TABLE_SCHEMA: sr_hub
     TABLE_NAME: sr_member
     TABLE_TYPE: BASE TABLE
         ENGINE: StarRocks
        VERSION: NULL
     ROW_FORMAT: NULL
     TABLE_ROWS: 6
 AVG_ROW_LENGTH: 542
    DATA_LENGTH: 3255
MAX_DATA_LENGTH: NULL
   INDEX_LENGTH: NULL
      DATA_FREE: NULL
 AUTO_INCREMENT: NULL
    CREATE_TIME: 2022-11-17 14:32:30
    UPDATE_TIME: 2022-11-17 14:32:55
     CHECK_TIME: NULL
TABLE_COLLATION: utf8_general_ci
       CHECKSUM: NULL
 CREATE_OPTIONS: NULL
  TABLE_COMMENT: OLAP
1 row in set (1.04 sec)
```

## Information Schema tables

StarRocks has optimized the metadata information provided by the tables `tables`, `tables_config`, and `load_tracking_logs` and has provided the `loads` table from v3.1 onwards in `information_schema`:

| **Information Schema table name** | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [tables](#tables)                            | Provides general metadata information of tables.             |
| [tables_config](#tables_config)                     | Provides additional table metadata information that is unique to StarRocks. |
| [load_tracking_logs](#load_tracking_logs)                | Provides error information (if any) of load jobs. |
| [loads](#loads)                             | Provides the results of load jobs. This table is supported from v3.1 onwards. Currently, you can only view the results of [Broker Load](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD.md) and [Insert](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/INSERT.md) jobs from this table.                 |
