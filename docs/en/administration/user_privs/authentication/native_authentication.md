# Native Authentication

Create and manage users using the native authentication within StarRocks through SQL commands.

StarRocks native authentication is a password-based authentication method. In addition to that, StarRocks also supports integrating with external authentication systems such as LDAP, OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0. For more instructions, see [Authenticate with Security Integration](./security_integration.md).

:::note

Users with the system-defined role `user_admin` can create users, alter users, and drop users in StarRocks.

:::

## Create user

You can create a user by specifying the user identity, the authentication method, and optionally the default role. To enable the native authentication for the user, you need to explicitly specify the password in plaintext or ciphertext.

The following example creates the user `jack`, allows it to connect only from the IP address `172.10.1.10`, enables the native authentication, sets the password to `12345` in plaintext, and assigns the role `example_role` to it as its default role:

```SQL
CREATE USER jack@'172.10.1.10' IDENTIFIED BY '12345' DEFAULT ROLE 'example_role';
```

:::note
- StarRocks encrypts users' passwords before storing them. You can get the encrypted password using the password() function.
- A system-defined default role `PUBLIC` is assigned to a user if no default role is specified during user creation.
:::

The default role of a user is automatically activated when the user connects to StarRocks. For instructions on how to enable all (default and granted) roles for a user after connection, see [Enable all roles](../authorization/User_privilege.md#enable-all-roles).

For more information and advanced instructions on creating a user, see [CREATE USER](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/CREATE_USER.md).

## Alter user

You can alter the password, default role, or property for a user.

For instructions on how to alter the default role for a user, see [Alter default role](../authorization/User_privilege.md#alter-the-default-role-of-a-user).

### Alter the property of a user

You can set the property of a user using [ALTER USER](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/ALTER_USER.md).

The following example sets the maximum number of connections for user `jack` to `1000`. User identities that have the same user name share the same property.

Therefore, you only need to set the property for `jack` and this setting takes effect for all the user identities with the user name `jack`.

```SQL
ALTER USER 'jack' SET PROPERTIES ("max_user_connections" = "1000");
```

### Reset password for a user

You can reset the password for a user using [SET PASSWORD](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/SET_PASSWORD.md) or [ALTER USER](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/ALTER_USER.md).

> **NOTE**
>
> - Any user can reset their own passwords without needing any privileges.
> - Only the `root` user itself can set its password. If you have lost its password and cannot connect to StarRocks, see [Reset lost root password](#reset-lost-root-password) for more instructions.

Both the following examples reset the password of `jack` to `54321`:

- Reset the password using SET PASSWORD:

  ```SQL
  SET PASSWORD FOR jack@'172.10.1.10' = PASSWORD('54321');
  ```

- Reset the password using ALTER USER:

  ```SQL
  ALTER USER jack@'172.10.1.10' IDENTIFIED BY '54321';
  ```

#### Reset lost root password

If you have lost the password of the `root` user and cannot connect to StarRocks, you can reset it by following these procedures:

1. Add the following configuration item to the configuration files **fe/conf/fe.conf** of **all FE nodes** to disable user authentication:

   ```YAML
   enable_auth_check = false
   ```

2. Restart **all FE nodes** to allow the configuration to take effect.

   ```Bash
   ./fe/bin/stop_fe.sh
   ./fe/bin/start_fe.sh
   ```

3. Connect from a MySQL client to StarRocks via the `root` user. You do not need to specify the password when user authentication is disabled.

   ```Bash
   mysql -h <fe_ip_or_fqdn> -P<fe_query_port> -uroot
   ```

4. Reset the password for the `root` user.

   ```SQL
   SET PASSWORD for root = PASSWORD('xxxxxx');
   ```

5. Re-enable user authentication by setting the configuration item `enable_auth_check` to `true` in the configuration files **fe/conf/fe.conf** of **all FE nodes**.

   ```YAML
   enable_auth_check = true
   ```

6. Restart **all FE nodes** to allow the configuration to take effect.

   ```Bash
   ./fe/bin/stop_fe.sh
   ./fe/bin/start_fe.sh
   ```

7. Connect from a MySQL client to StarRocks using the `root` user and the new password to verify whether the password is reset successfully.

   ```Bash
   mysql -h <fe_ip_or_fqdn> -P<fe_query_port> -uroot -p<xxxxxx>
   ```

## Drop a user

You can drop a user using [DROP USER](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/DROP_USER.md).

The following example drops the user `jack`:

```SQL
DROP USER jack@'172.10.1.10';
```

## View users

You can view all the users within the StarRocks cluster using SHOW USERS.

```SQL
SHOW USERS;
```

## View user property

You can view the property of a user using [SHOW PROPERTY](../../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/SHOW_PROPERTY.md).

The following example shows the property of the user `jack`:

```SQL
SHOW PROPERTY FOR jack@'172.10.1.10';
```
