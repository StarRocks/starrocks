# LDAP Authentication

In addition to native password-based authentication, StarRocks also supports the LDAP authentication.

This topic describes how to manually create and authenticate users using LDAP in StarRocks. For instructions on how to integrate StarRocks with your LDAP service using security integration, see [Authenticate with Security Integration](./security_integration.md). For more information on how to authenticate user groups in your LDAP service, see [Authenticate User Groups](../group_provider.md).

## Enable LDAD authentication

To use LDAP authentication, you need to add the LDAP service into the FE node configuration first.

```Properties
# Add the LDAP service IP address.
authentication_ldap_simple_server_host =
# Add the LDAP service port, with a default value of 389.
authentication_ldap_simple_server_port =
# Whether to allow non-encrypted connections to the LDAP server. Default value: `true`. Setting this value to `false` indicates that SSL encryption is required to access LDAP.
authentication_ldap_simple_ssl_conn_allow_insecure = 
# Local path to store the SSL CA certificate of the LDAP server. Supports pem and jks formats. You do not need to set this item if the certificate is issued by a trusted organization.
authentication_ldap_simple_ssl_conn_trust_store_path = 
# The password used to access the locally stored SSL CA certificate of the LDAP server. pem-formatted certificates do not require a password. Only jsk-formatted certificates do.
authentication_ldap_simple_ssl_conn_trust_store_pwd = 
```

If you wish to authenticate users by means of StarRocks retrieving them directly in the LDAP system, you will need to **add the following additional configuration items**.

```Properties
# Add the Base DN of the user, specifying the user's retrieval range.
authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn =
# Add the name of the attribute that identifies the user in the LDAP object. Default: uid.
authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr =
# Add the admin DN for retrieving users.
authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn =
# Add the admin password for retrieving users.
authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_pwd =
```

## DN Matching Mechanism

Starting from v3.5.0, StarRocks supports recording and passing user Distinguished Name (DN) information during LDAP authentication to provide more accurate group resolution.

### How it Works

1. **Authentication Phase**: LDAPAuthProvider records both pieces of information after successful user authentication:
   - Login username (for traditional group matching)
   - User's complete DN (for DN-based group matching)

2. **Group Resolution Phase**: LDAPGroupProvider determines the matching strategy based on the `ldap_user_search_attr` parameter configuration:
   - **When `ldap_user_search_attr` is configured**, it uses username as the key for group matching.
   - **When `ldap_user_search_attr` is not configured**, it uses DN as the key for group matching.

### Use Cases

- **Traditional LDAP Environment**: Group members use simple usernames (such as `cn` attribute). Administrators need to configure `ldap_user_search_attr`.
- **Microsoft AD Environment**: Group members may lack username attributes. `ldap_user_search_attr` cannot be configured. The system will use DN directly for matching.
- **Mixed Environment**: Flexible switching between both matching methods is supported.

## Create a user with LDAP

When creating a user, specify the authentication method as LDAP authentication by `IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple AS 'xxx'`. xxx is the DN (Distinguished Name) of the user in LDAP.

Example 1:

```sql
CREATE USER tom IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple AS 'uid=tom,ou=company,dc=example,dc=com'
```

It is possible to create a user without specifying the user's DN in LDAP. When the user logs in, StarRocks will go to the LDAP system to retrieve the user information. if there is one and only one match, the authentication is successful.

Example 2:

```sql
CREATE USER tom IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
```

In this case, additional configuration needs to be added to the FE

- `authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn`: The base DN of the user, specifying the retrieval range of the user.
- `authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr`: The name of the attribute in the LDAP object that identifies the user, uid by default.
- `authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn`: The DN of the administrator account used to retrieve the user information.
- `authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_pwd`: The password of the administrator account used when retrieving the user information.

## Authenticate users

LDAP authentication requires the client to pass on a clear-text password to StarRocks. There are three ways to pass on a clear-text password:

### Connect from MySQL client with LDAP

Add `--default-auth mysql_clear_password --enable-cleartext-plugin` when executing:

```sql
mysql -utom -P8030 -h127.0.0.1 -p --default-auth mysql_clear_password --enable-cleartext-plugin
```

### Connect from JDBC/ODBC client with LDAP

- **JDBC**

Note that when you use JDBC connections, you must enable SSL on the server side. For more information, see [SSL Authentication](../ssl_authentication.md).

JDBC 5:

```java
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.put("authenticationPlugins", "com.mysql.jdbc.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin");
properties.put("defaultAuthenticationPlugin", "com.mysql.jdbc.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin");
properties.put("disabledAuthenticationPlugins", "com.mysql.jdbc.authentication.MysqlNativePasswordPlugin");
```

JDBC 8:

```java
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.put("authenticationPlugins", "com.mysql.cj.protocol.a.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin");
properties.put("defaultAuthenticationPlugin", "com.mysql.cj.protocol.a.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin");
properties.put("disabledAuthenticationPlugins", "com.mysql.cj.protocol.a.authentication.MysqlNativePasswordPlugin");
```

- **ODBC**

Add `default\_auth=mysql_clear_password` and `ENABLE_CLEARTEXT\_PLUGIN=1` in the DSN of ODBC: , along with username and password.
