### Create a database

Type these two lines in at the `StarRocks > ` prompt and press enter after each:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS quickstart;

USE quickstart;
```

### Create two tables

#### Crashdata

The crash dataset contains many more fields than these, the schema has been trimmed
down to include only the fields that might be useful to answer questions about the
impact weather has on driving conditions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crashdata (
    CRASH_DATE DATETIME,
    BOROUGH STRING,
    ZIP_CODE STRING,
    LATITUDE INT,
    LONGITUDE INT,
    LOCATION STRING,
    ON_STREET_NAME STRING,
    CROSS_STREET_NAME STRING,
    OFF_STREET_NAME STRING,
    CONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_1 STRING,
    CONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_2 STRING,
    COLLISION_ID INT,
    VEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_1 STRING,
    VEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_2 STRING
);
```

#### Weatherdata

Similar to the crash data, the weather dataset has many more columns (a total of
125 columns) and only the ones that are expected to answer the questions are
included in the database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weatherdata (
    DATE DATETIME,
    NAME STRING,
    HourlyDewPointTemperature STRING,
    HourlyDryBulbTemperature STRING,
    HourlyPrecipitation STRING,
    HourlyPresentWeatherType STRING,
    HourlyPressureChange STRING,
    HourlyPressureTendency STRING,
    HourlyRelativeHumidity STRING,
    HourlySkyConditions STRING,
    HourlyVisibility STRING,
    HourlyWetBulbTemperature STRING,
    HourlyWindDirection STRING,
    HourlyWindGustSpeed STRING,
    HourlyWindSpeed STRING
);
```
