This command is for your reference, if you are using AWS, Azure, or any other Kubernetes provider you will need to modify this for your environment. In Google Cloud you will need to specify your own project and an appropriate location.

```bash
gcloud container --project enterprise-demo-422514 \
  clusters create ee-docs \
  --location=southamerica-west1-b \
  --machine-type e2-standard-4 --disk-size 80 --num-nodes 3
```
