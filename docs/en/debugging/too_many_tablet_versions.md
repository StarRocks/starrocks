# Debugging tablet errors

Avoiding the "too many versions" error.

This error indicates that the number of tablet versions in your StarRocks database has exceeded the default maximum limit of 1000.
```sh
previous task aborted because of Failed to load data into tablet xyz,
because of too many versions, current/limit: 1002/1000
```

## Terms

### Tablet

A tablet is the fundamental physical storage unit for data.

Here's a breakdown of what a tablet is and its role:

- **Physical Storage Unit**:\
   A table in StarRocks is logically divided into partitions, and each partition is further divided into multiple buckets. The data within a single bucket is referred to as a tablet.

- **Distribution and Replication**:\
   Tablets are the actual units that are distributed across different Backend (BE) nodes in the StarRocks cluster. They are also the units that are replicated to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Creation Mechanism**:\
   Tablets are created through the data distribution process, which typically involves:

  - Partitioning:\
   Dividing the table data based on a partition key (optional).
  - Bucketing:\
   Dividing a partition into multiple buckets (tablets) using a bucketing method, such as hash bucketing (based on a bucketing key) or random bucketing.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - It contains a subset of the table's data.
  - It has properties like a unique TABLET_ID, NUM_ROW, DATA_SIZE, and a MAX_VERSION (representing the latest data version).
  - Its replicas on different BEs are managed to maintain consistency and availability.

### Tablet version

Each tablet maintains multiple versions to track data changes (e.g., inserts, updates). Each write operation creates a new version, and compaction merges these versions to keep the count below the limit (default: 1000).

### Compaction

Compaction is a background process that merges the versions of a tablet. These merges reduce the version count below the limit (default: 1000).

## Cause of the "too many versions" error

This typically occurs due to frequent data loading operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, or Routine Load) outpacing the system's ability to compact these versions, leading to an accumulation of unmerged tablet versions.

## Understanding the Error

Tablet Versions in StarRocks: StarRocks divides tables into tablets for parallel processing, with each tablet maintaining versions to track data changes (e.g., inserts, updates). Each write operation creates a new version, and compaction merges these versions to keep the count below the limit (default: 1000).

**Error cause**: The error occurs when the version count exceeds 1000 (here, 1002) due to:

- High-frequency loading (e.g., many small INSERTs or Routine Loads).
- Slow or insufficient compaction, leaving versions unmerged.
- Configuration issues, such as low compaction resources or high load concurrency.

**Error impact**: New write requests fail until the version count is reduced, 

## Steps to Debug and Resolve

1. Verify Tablet Status

   Confirm the affected tablet’s version count.

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLET 21635;  -- Replace 21635 with your tablet ID
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.be_tablets WHERE TABLET_ID = 21635;
   ```

   Check: Version count (>1000), Backend ID, tablet state.

2. Analyze Load Jobs

   Identify frequent or small-batch loads causing version buildup.

   ```sql
   SHOW LOAD WHERE STATE = 'FINISHED' OR STATE = 'RUNNING';
   SHOW ROUTINE LOAD WHERE STATE = 'RUNNING';
   ```

   Check: High-frequency INSERTs, Routine Load concurrency (desired_concurrent_number), small batch sizes (max_routine_load_batch_size).
3. Check Compaction Performance

   Assess compaction lag.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.be_compactions;
   ```

   Check: High compaction scores (>100), pending tablets, high CPU/I/O on BE nodes.
4. Apply Immediate Workarounds

   Reduce version count to resume writes:

   - Increase Batch Size (Routine Load):

      ```sh
      "max_routine_load_batch_size" = 8589934592
      ```

   - Reduce Concurrency:

      ```sql
      ALTER ROUTINE LOAD FOR example_db.example_job
      PROPERTIES (
        "desired_concurrent_number" = "2"  -- Default: 3;
      );
      ```
   
   - Pause Loads:

      ```sql
      PAUSE ROUTINE LOAD FOR example_db.example_job;
      ```

   - Monitor: Wait 5–10 minutes, then verify:

      ```sql
      SHOW TABLET <tablet ID>;
      ```

5. Optimize BE Compaction

   Edit `be.conf` on each BE node and restart:

      ```sh
      cumulative_compaction_num_threads_per_disk = 4  # Default: 2
      base_compaction_num_threads_per_disk = 2       # Default: 1
      cumulative_compaction_check_interval_seconds = 2  # Default: 10
      ```

   For Primary Key tables:

      ```sh
      update_compaction_num_threads_per_disk = 4      # Default: 1
      update_compaction_per_tablet_min_interval_seconds = 60  # Default: 120
      ```

   Monitor: CPU/I/O usage:

      `top`\
      `iostat -x 1`

6. Tune FE Settings (Optional)

   For Routine Load-heavy workloads, persist these settings in `fe.conf`:

      ```sh
      max_routine_load_task_num_per_be = 32  # Default: 16
      max_routine_load_batch_size = 8589934592  # 8MB
      routine_load_task_consume_second = 10 
      ```

7. Handle Special Cases

   - High Partition/Columns:
      ```sql
      SET GLOBAL statistic_collect_parallel = 4;  -- Default: 1
      ```

8. Validate and Monitor

   - Recheck versions:
      ```sql
      SHOW TABLET 21635;
      ```
   - Resume loads and test INSERTs.
   - Monitor compaction weekly:

      ```sql
      SELECT * from information_schema.be_compactions; --shared nothing
      SELECT * from information_schema.be_cloud_native_compactions; --shared data
      ```

## Expected Outcomes

   - Short-Term: Versions drop below 1000, restoring writes.
   - Long-Term: Optimized settings prevent recurrence.

## Notes

   - Use StarRocks v3.3+ for compaction improvements.
   - Adjust BE threads for cluster size.
