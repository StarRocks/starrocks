## Data types of key and value columns

The key columns support the following data types: numeric (including integers, BOOLEAN, and DECIMAL), string, and date (DATE and DATETIME).

:::note
The key columns of a Primary Key table do not support the DECIMAL data type.
:::

On the other hand, the value columns support basic data types, including numeric, string, and date (DATE and DATETIME). The support for BITMAP, HLL, and semi-structured types varies for value columns of different types of tables, as detailed below:
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th> </th><th><strong>Primary Key</strong> <strong>table</strong></th><th><strong>Duplicate Key table</strong></th><th><strong>Aggregate table</strong></th><th><strong>Unique Key table</strong></th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>BITMAP</strong></td><td>Supported</td><td>Not supported   </td><td>Supported. The aggregate functions  must be bitmap_union, replace, or replace_if_not_null. </td><td>Supported </td></tr><tr><td><strong>HLL</strong></td><td>Supported </td><td>Not supported  </td><td>Supported. The aggregate functions must be hll_union, replace, or replace_if_not_null. </td><td>Supported </td></tr><tr><td><strong>PERCENTILE</strong></td><td>Supported </td><td>Not supported  </td><td>Supported.
