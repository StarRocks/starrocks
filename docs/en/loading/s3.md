# Load data from AWS S3

StarRocks provides the following options for loading data from AWS S3:

- Synchronous loading using [INSERT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/INSERT.md)+[`FILES()`](../sql-reference/sql-functions/table-functions/files.md)
- Asynchronous loading using [Broker Load](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD.md)
- Continuous asynchronous loading using [Pipe](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/CREATE_PIPE.md)

Each of these options has its own advantages, which are detailed in the following sections.

In most cases, we recommend that you use the INSERT+`FILES()` method, which is much easier to use.

However, the INSERT+`FILES()` method currently supports only the Parquet and ORC file formats. Therefore, if you need to load data of other file formats such as CSV, or [perform data changes such as DELETE during data loading](../loading/Load_to_Primary_Key_tables.md), you can resort to Broker Load.

If you need to load a large number of data files with a significant data volume in total (for example, more than 100 GB or even 1 TB), we recommend that you use the Pipe method. Pipe can split the files based on their number or size, breaking down the load job into smaller, sequential tasks. This approach ensures that errors in one file do not impact the entire load job and minimizes the need for retries due to data errors.

## Before you begin

### Make source data ready

Make sure the source data you want to load into StarRocks is properly stored in an S3 bucket. You may also consider where the data and the database are located, because data transfer costs are much lower when your bucket and your StarRocks cluster are located in the same region.

In this topic, we provide you with a sample dataset in an S3 bucket, `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet`. You can access that dataset with any valid credentials as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

### Check privileges

You can load data into StarRocks tables only as a user who has the INSERT privilege on those StarRocks tables. If you do not have the INSERT privilege, follow the instructions provided in [GRANT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/GRANT.md) to grant the INSERT privilege to the user that you use to connect to your StarRocks cluster.

### Gather connection details

The examples in this topic use IAM user-based authentication. To ensure that you have permission to read data from AWS S3, we recommend that you read [Preparation for IAM user-based authentication](../integrations/authenticate_to_aws_resources.md) and follow the instructions to create an IAM user with proper [IAM policies](../reference/aws_iam_policies.md) configured.

In a nutshell, if you practice IAM user-based authentication, you need to gather information about the following AWS resources:

- The S3 bucket that stores your data.
- The S3 object key (object name) if accessing a specific object in the bucket. Note that the object key can include a prefix if your S3 objects are stored in sub-folders.
- The AWS region to which the S3 bucket belongs.
- The access key and secret key used as access credentials.

For information about all the authentication methods available, see [Authenticate to AWS resources](../integrations/authenticate_to_aws_resources.md).

## Use INSERT+FILES()

This method is available from v3.1 onwards and currently supports only the Parquet and ORC file formats.

### Advantages of INSERT+FILES()

[`FILES()`](../sql-reference/sql-functions/table-functions/files.md) can read the file stored in cloud storage based on the path-related properties you specify, infer the table schema of the data in the file, and then return the data from the file as data rows.

With `FILES()`, you can:

- Query the data directly from S3 using [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SELECT.md).
- Create and load a table using [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT.md) (CTAS).
- Load the data into an existing table using [INSERT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/INSERT.md).

### Typical examples

#### Querying directly from S3 using SELECT

Querying directly from S3 using SELECT+`FILES()` can give a good preview of the content of a dataset before you create a table. For example:

- Get a preview of the dataset without storing the data.
- Query for the min and max values and decide what data types to use.
- Check for `NULL` values.

The following example queries the sample dataset `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet`:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM FILES
(
    "path" = "s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet",
    "format" = "parquet",
    "aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
    "aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
)
LIMIT 3;
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Substitute your credentials for `AAA` and `BBB` in the above command. Any valid `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.secret_key` can be used, as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

The system returns the following query result:

```Plaintext
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| UserID | ItemID  | CategoryID | BehaviorType | Timestamp           |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| 543711 |  829192 |    2355072 | pv           | 2017-11-27 08:22:37 |
| 543711 | 2056618 |    3645362 | pv           | 2017-11-27 10:16:46 |
| 543711 | 1165492 |    3645362 | pv           | 2017-11-27 10:17:00 |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Notice that the column names as returned above are provided by the Parquet file.

#### Creating and loading a table using CTAS

This is a continuation of the previous example. The previous query is wrapped in CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) to automate the table creation using schema inference. This means StarRocks will infer the table schema, create the table you want, and then load the data into the table. The column names and types are not required to create a table when using the `FILES()` table function with Parquet files as the Parquet format includes the column names.

> **NOTE**
>
> The syntax of CREATE TABLE when using schema inference does not allow setting the number of replicas, so set it before creating the table. The example below is for a system with a single replica:
>
> ```SQL
> ADMIN SET FRONTEND CONFIG ('default_replication_num' = "1");
> ```

Create a database and switch to it:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
USE mydatabase;
```

Use CTAS to create a table and load the data of the sample dataset `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet` into the table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE user_behavior_inferred AS
SELECT * FROM FILES
(
    "path" = "s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet",
    "format" = "parquet",
    "aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
    "aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
);
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Substitute your credentials for `AAA` and `BBB` in the above command. Any valid `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.secret_key` can be used, as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

After creating the table, you can view its schema by using [DESCRIBE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Utility/DESCRIBE.md):

```SQL
DESCRIBE user_behavior_inferred;
```

The system returns the following query result:

```Plaintext
+--------------+------------------+------+-------+---------+-------+
| Field        | Type             | Null | Key   | Default | Extra |
+--------------+------------------+------+-------+---------+-------+
| UserID       | bigint           | YES  | true  | NULL    |       |
| ItemID       | bigint           | YES  | true  | NULL    |       |
| CategoryID   | bigint           | YES  | true  | NULL    |       |
| BehaviorType | varchar(1048576) | YES  | false | NULL    |       |
| Timestamp    | varchar(1048576) | YES  | false | NULL    |       |
+--------------+------------------+------+-------+---------+-------+
```

Compare the inferred schema with the schema created by hand:

- data types
- nullable
- key fields

To better control the schema of the destination table and for better query performance, we recommend that you specify the table schema by hand in production environments.

Query the table to verify that the data has been loaded into it. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * from user_behavior_inferred LIMIT 3;
```

The following query result is returned, indicating that the data has been successfully loaded:

```Plaintext
+--------+--------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| UserID | ItemID | CategoryID | BehaviorType | Timestamp           |
+--------+--------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
|     58 | 158350 |    2355072 | pv           | 2017-11-27 13:06:51 |
|     58 | 158590 |    3194735 | pv           | 2017-11-27 02:21:04 |
|     58 | 215073 |    3002561 | pv           | 2017-11-30 10:55:42 |
+--------+--------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
```

#### Loading into an existing table using INSERT

You may want to customize the table that you are inserting into, for example, the:

- column data type, nullable setting, or default values
- key types and columns
- data partitioning and bucketing

> **NOTE**
>
> Creating the most efficient table structure requires knowledge of how the data will be used and the content of the columns. This topic does not cover table design. For information about table design, see [Table types](../table_design/StarRocks_table_design.md).

In this example, we are creating a table based on knowledge of how the table will be queried and the data in the Parquet file. The knowledge of the data in the Parquet file can be gained by querying the file directly in S3.

- Since a query of the dataset in S3 indicates that the `Timestamp` column contains data that matches a `datetime` data type, the column type is specified in the following DDL.
- By querying the data in S3, you can find that there are no `NULL` values in the dataset, so the DDL does not set any columns as nullable.
- Based on knowledge of the expected query types, the sort key and bucketing column are set to the column `UserID`. Your use case might be different for this data, so you might decide to use `ItemID` in addition to or instead of `UserID` for the sort key.

Create a database and switch to it:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
USE mydatabase;
```

Create a table by hand (we recommend that the table have the same schema as the Parquet file you want to load from AWS S3):

```SQL
CREATE TABLE user_behavior_declared
(
    UserID int(11),
    ItemID int(11),
    CategoryID int(11),
    BehaviorType varchar(65533),
    Timestamp datetime
)
ENGINE = OLAP 
DUPLICATE KEY(UserID)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(UserID)
PROPERTIES
(
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

After creating the table, you can load it with INSERT INTO SELECT FROM FILES():

```SQL
INSERT INTO user_behavior_declared
SELECT * FROM FILES
(
    "path" = "s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet",
    "format" = "parquet",
    "aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
    "aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
);
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Substitute your credentials for `AAA` and `BBB` in the above command. Any valid `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.secret_key` can be used, as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

After the load is complete, you can query the table to verify that the data has been loaded into it. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * from user_behavior_declared LIMIT 3;
```

The following query result is returned, indicating that the data has been successfully loaded:

```Plaintext
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| UserID | ItemID  | CategoryID | BehaviorType | Timestamp           |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
|     58 | 4309692 |    1165503 | pv           | 2017-11-25 14:06:52 |
|     58 |  181489 |    1165503 | pv           | 2017-11-25 14:07:22 |
|     58 | 3722956 |    1165503 | pv           | 2017-11-25 14:09:28 |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
```

#### Check load progress

You can query the progress of INSERT jobs from the [`information_schema.loads`](../reference/information_schema/loads.md) view. This feature is supported from v3.1 onwards. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.loads ORDER BY JOB_ID DESC;
```

If you have submitted multiple load jobs, you can filter on the `LABEL` associated with the job. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.loads WHERE LABEL = 'insert_e3b882f5-7eb3-11ee-ae77-00163e267b60' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
              JOB_ID: 10243

```

For information about the fields provided in the `loads` view, see [Information Schema](../reference/information_schema/loads.md).

> **NOTE**
>
> INSERT is a synchronous command. If an INSERT job is still running, you need to open another session to check its execution status.

## Use Broker Load

An asynchronous Broker Load process handles making the connection to S3, pulling the data, and storing the data in StarRocks.

This method supports the Parquet, ORC, and CSV file formats.

### Advantages of Broker Load

- Broker Load supports [data transformation](../loading/Etl_in_loading.md) and [data changes such as UPSERT and DELETE operations](../loading/Load_to_Primary_Key_tables.md) during loading.
- Broker Load runs in the background and clients do not need to stay connected for the job to continue.
- Broker Load is preferred for long-running jobs, with the default timeout spanning 4 hours.
- In addition to Parquet and ORC file formats, Broker Load supports CSV files.

### Data flow

![Workflow of Broker Load](../assets/broker_load_how-to-work_en.png)

1. The user creates a load job.
2. The frontend (FE) creates a query plan and distributes the plan to the backend nodes (BEs).
3. The BEs pull the data from the source and load the data into StarRocks.

### Typical example

Create a table, start a load process that pulls the sample dataset `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet` from S3, and verify the progress and success of the data loading.

#### Create a database and a table

Create a database and switch to it:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
USE mydatabase;
```

Create a table by hand (we recommend that the table has the same schema as the Parquet file that you want to load from AWS S3):

```SQL
CREATE TABLE user_behavior
(
    UserID int(11),
    ItemID int(11),
    CategoryID int(11),
    BehaviorType varchar(65533),
    Timestamp datetime
)
ENGINE = OLAP 
DUPLICATE KEY(UserID)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(UserID)
PROPERTIES
(
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

#### Start a Broker Load

Run the following command to start a Broker Load job that loads data from the sample dataset `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet` to the `user_behavior` table:

```SQL
LOAD LABEL user_behavior
(
    DATA INFILE("s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet")
    INTO TABLE user_behavior
    FORMAT AS "parquet"
 )
 WITH BROKER
 (
    "aws.s3.enable_ssl" = "true",
    "aws.s3.use_instance_profile" = "false",
    "aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
    "aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
 )
PROPERTIES
(
    "timeout" = "72000"
);
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Substitute your credentials for `AAA` and `BBB` in the above command. Any valid `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.secret_key` can be used, as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

This job has four main sections:

- `LABEL`: A string used when querying the state of the load job.
- `LOAD` declaration: The source URI, source data format, and destination table name.
- `BROKER`: The connection details for the source.
- `PROPERTIES`: The timeout value and any other properties to apply to the load job.

For detailed syntax and parameter descriptions, see [BROKER LOAD](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD.md).

#### Check load progress

You can query the progress of Broker Load jobs from the [`information_schema.loads`](../reference/information_schema/loads.md) view. This feature is supported from v3.1 onwards.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.loads;
```

For information about the fields provided in the `loads` view, see [Information Schema](../reference/information_schema/loads.md).

If you have submitted multiple load jobs, you can filter on the `LABEL` associated with the job. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.loads WHERE LABEL = 'user_behavior';
```

In the output below there are two entries for the load job `user_behavior`:

- The first record shows a state of `CANCELLED`. Scroll to `ERROR_MSG`, and you can see that the job has failed due to `listPath failed`.
- The second record shows a state of `FINISHED`, which means that the job has succeeded.

```Plaintext
JOB_ID|LABEL                                      |DATABASE_NAME|STATE    |PROGRESS           |TYPE  |PRIORITY|SCAN_ROWS|FILTERED_ROWS|UNSELECTED_ROWS|SINK_ROWS|ETL_INFO|TASK_INFO                                           |CREATE_TIME        |ETL_START_TIME     |ETL_FINISH_TIME    |LOAD_START_TIME    |LOAD_FINISH_TIME   |JOB_DETAILS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |ERROR_MSG                             |TRACKING_URL|TRACKING_SQL|REJECTED_RECORD_PATH|

```

After you confirm that the load job has finished, you can check a subset of the destination table to see if the data has been successfully loaded. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * from user_behavior LIMIT 3;
```

The following query result is returned, indicating that the data has been successfully loaded:

```Plaintext
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
| UserID | ItemID  | CategoryID | BehaviorType | Timestamp           |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+

|    142 | 3031639 |    3607361 | pv           | 2017-11-25 15:19:25 |
+--------+---------+------------+--------------+---------------------+
```

## Use Pipe

Starting from v3.2, StarRocks supports using Pipe to continuously load data from AWS S3 in micro-batches, allowing for quick access to the loaded data within minutes. This method eliminates the need to manually run load commands on a scheduled basis, making it ideal for continuous data loading and large-scale data loading.

The Pipe method currently supports only the Parquet and ORC file formats.

### Advantages of Pipe

- **Large-scale data loading in micro-batches helps reduce the cost of retries caused by data errors.**

  With the help of Pipe, StarRocks enables the efficient loading of a large number of data files with a significant data volume in total. Pipe automatically splits the files based on their number or size, breaking down the load job into smaller, sequential tasks. This approach ensures that errors in one file do not impact the entire load job. The load status of each file is recorded by Pipe, allowing you to easily identify and fix files that contain errors. By minimizing the need for retries due to data errors, this approach helps to reduce costs.

- **Continuous data loading helps reduce manpower.**

  Pipe helps you write new or updated data files to a specific location and continuously load the new data from these files into StarRocks. Once a Pipe job is created, it will constantly monitor changes in the data files stored under a specific directory and automatically load new or updated data from the data files into the destination StarRocks table.

- **File uniqueness check helps prevent duplicate data loading.**

  During the loading process, Pipe checks the uniqueness of each data file based on the file name and digest. If a file with a specific file name and digest has already been processed by a Pipe job, the Pipe job will skip all subsequent files with the same file name and digest. Note that object storage like AWS S3 uses `ETag` as file digest.

The load status of each data file is recorded and saved to the `information_schema.pipe_files` view. After a Pipe job associated with the view is deleted, the records about the files loaded in that job will also be deleted.

### Data flow

![Pipe data flow](../assets/pipe_data_flow.png)

### Differences between Pipe and INSERT+FILES()

A Pipe job is split into one or more transactions based on the size and number of rows in each data file. Users can query the intermediate results during the loading process. In contrast, an INSERT+`FILES()` job is processed as a single transaction, and users are unable to view the data during the loading process.

### File loading sequence

For each Pipe job, StarRocks maintains a file queue, from which it fetches and loads data files as micro-batches. Pipe does not ensure that the data files are loaded in the same order as they are uploaded. Therefore, newer data may be loaded prior to older data.

### Typical example

#### Create a database and a table

Create a database and switch to it:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
USE mydatabase;
```

Create a table by hand (we recommend that the table have the same schema as the Parquet file you want to load from AWS S3):

```SQL
CREATE TABLE user_behavior_replica
(
    UserID int(11),
    ItemID int(11),
    CategoryID int(11),
    BehaviorType varchar(65533),
    Timestamp datetime
)
ENGINE = OLAP 
DUPLICATE KEY(UserID)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(UserID)
PROPERTIES
(
    "replication_num" = "1"
);
```

#### Start a Pipe job

Run the following command to start a Pipe job that loads data from the sample dataset `s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet` to the `user_behavior_replica` table:

```SQL
CREATE PIPE user_behavior_replica
PROPERTIES
(
    "AUTO_INGEST" = "TRUE"
)
AS
INSERT INTO user_behavior_replica
SELECT * FROM FILES
(
    "path" = "s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet",
    "format" = "parquet",
    "aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
    "aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
); 
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Substitute your credentials for `AAA` and `BBB` in the above command. Any valid `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.secret_key` can be used, as the object is readable by any AWS authenticated user.

This job has four main sections:

- `pipe_name`: The name of the pipe. The pipe name must be unique within the database to which the pipe belongs.
- `INSERT_SQL`: The INSERT INTO SELECT FROM FILES statement that is used to load data from the specified source data file to the destination table.
- `PROPERTIES`: A set of optional parameters that specify how to execute the pipe. These include `AUTO_INGEST`, `POLL_INTERVAL`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `BATCH_FILES`. Specify these properties in the `"key" = "value"` format.

For detailed syntax and parameter descriptions, see [CREATE PIPE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/CREATE_PIPE.md).

#### Check load progress

- Query the progress of Pipe jobs by using [SHOW PIPES](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_PIPES.md).

  ```SQL
  SHOW PIPES;
  ```

  If you have submitted multiple load jobs, you can filter on the `NAME` associated with the job. Example:

  ```SQL
  SHOW PIPES WHERE NAME = "user_behavior_replica" \G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  DATABASE_NAME: mydatabase
        PIPE_ID: 10217
      PIPE_NAME: user_behavior_replica
          STATE: RUNNING
     TABLE_NAME: mydatabase.user_behavior_replica
    LOAD_STATUS: {"loadedFiles":1,"loadedBytes":132251298,"loadingFiles":0,"lastLoadedTime":"2023-11-09 15:35:42"}
     LAST_ERROR: NULL
   CREATED_TIME: 2023-11-09 15:35:01
  1 row in set (0.01 sec)
  ```

- Query the progress of Pipe jobs from the [`information_schema.pipes`](../reference/information_schema/pipes.md) view.

  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.pipes;
  ```

  If you have submitted multiple load jobs, you can filter on the `PIPE_NAME` associated with the job. Example:

  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.pipes WHERE pipe_name = 'user_behavior_replica' \G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  DATABASE_NAME: mydatabase
        PIPE_ID: 10217
      PIPE_NAME: user_behavior_replica
          STATE: RUNNING
     TABLE_NAME: mydatabase.user_behavior_replica
    LOAD_STATUS: {"loadedFiles":1,"loadedBytes":132251298,"loadingFiles":0,"lastLoadedTime":"2023-11-09 15:35:42"}
     LAST_ERROR:
   CREATED_TIME: 9891-01-15 07:51:45
  1 row in set (0.01 sec)
  ```

#### Check file status

You can query the load status of the files loaded from the [`information_schema.pipe_files`](../reference/information_schema/pipe_files.md) view.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.pipe_files;
```

If you have submitted multiple load jobs, you can filter on the `PIPE_NAME` associated with the job. Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM information_schema.pipe_files WHERE pipe_name = 'user_behavior_replica' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
   DATABASE_NAME: mydatabase
         PIPE_ID: 10217
       PIPE_NAME: user_behavior_replica
       FILE_NAME: s3://starrocks-datasets/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet
    FILE_VERSION: e29daa86b1120fea58ad0d047e671787-8
       FILE_SIZE: 132251298
   LAST_MODIFIED: 2023-11-06 13:25:17
      LOAD_STATE: FINISHED
     STAGED_TIME: 2023-11-09 15:35:02
 START_LOAD_TIME: 2023-11-09 15:35:03
FINISH_LOAD_TIME: 2023-11-09 15:35:42
       ERROR_MSG:
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

#### Manage Pipe jobs

You can alter, suspend or resume, drop, or query the pipes you have created and retry to load specific data files. For more information, see [ALTER PIPE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/ALTER_PIPE.md), [SUSPEND or RESUME PIPE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SUSPEND_or_RESUME_PIPE.md), [DROP PIPE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/DROP_PIPE.md), [SHOW PIPES](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_PIPES.md), and [RETRY FILE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/RETRY_FILE.md).
