# DataX

## Why datax writer does not have writemode parameter? Why must the tables be created in the update mode?

Currently, only insert is supported.

## How to process keywords when I synchronize data by using DataX Writer?

Enclose a keyword in back quotes (``). If you want to download the newest version of DataX, see [DataX Writer.](../../integrations/loading_tools/DataX-starrocks-writer.md)
