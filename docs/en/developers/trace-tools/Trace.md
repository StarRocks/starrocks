### Background

&emsp;A Distributed Trace, more commonly known as a Trace, records the paths taken by requests (made by an application or end-user) as they propagate through multi-service architectures, like microservice and serverless applications. Without tracing, it is challenging to pinpoint the cause of performance problems in a distributed system. It improves the visibility of our application or systemâ€™s health and lets us debug behavior that is difficult to reproduce locally. Tracing is essential for distributed systems, which commonly have nondeterministic problems or are too complicated to reproduce locally.
&emsp;Tracing makes debugging and understanding distributed systems less daunting by breaking down what happens within a request as it flows through a distributed system. A Trace is made of one or more Spans. The first Span represents the Root Span. Each Root Span represents a request from start to finish. The Spans underneath the parent provide a more in-depth context of what occurs during a request (or what steps make up a request). Many Observability back-ends visualize Traces as waterfall diagrams that may look something like this picture.

&emsp;Waterfall diagrams show the parent-child relationship between a Root Span and its child Spans. When a Span encapsulates another Span, this also represents a nested relationship.
&emsp;Recently SR added a tracing framework. It leverages opentelemetry and jaeger to trace distributed events in the system.

*   Opentelemetry is an instrumentation/tracing SDK. Developers can use it to instrument code and emit tracing data to an observability backend. It supports many languages. We use java and CPP SDK in SR.
*   Currently, Jaeger is used as the observability backend.

### Basic Usage

Steps to enable tracing in SR:

1.  Install [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.31/getting-started)
    The guide above uses docker. For simplicity, you can also just download [binary package](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases) and run locally.

```
    decster@decster-MS-7C94:~/soft/jaeger-1.31.0-linux-amd64$ ll
    total 215836
    drwxr-xr-x  2 decster decster     4096 02-05 05:01:30 ./
    drwxrwxr-x 28 decster decster     4096 05-18 18:24:07 ../
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 19323884 02-05 05:01:31 example-hotrod*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 23430444 02-05 05:01:29 jaeger-agent*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 51694774 02-05 05:01:29 jaeger-all-in-one*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 41273869 02-05 05:01:30 jaeger-collector*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 37576660 02-05 05:01:30 jaeger-ingester*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 decster decster 47698843 02-05 05:01:30 jaeger-query*

    decster@decster-MS-7C94:~/soft/jaeger-1.31.0-linux-amd64$ ./jaeger-all-in-one 
```

2.  Config FE\&FE to enable tracing.
    Currently, opentelemetry java & cpp sdk use different protocols, java uses grpc proto, while cpp uses thrift\&UDP, so the endpoint ports are different.

```
    fe.conf

    # Enable jaeger tracing by setting jaeger_grpc_endpoint
    # jaeger_grpc_endpoint = http://localhost:14250


    be.conf

    # Enable jaeger tracing by setting jaeger_endpoint
    # jaeger_endpoint = localhost:6831
```

3.  Open jaeger web UI, usually in `http://localhost:16686/search`
4.  Do some data ingestion (streamload/insert into) and search TXN traces on web UI

### Adding traces

*   To add trace, first get familiar with basic concepts like tracer, span, trace propagation read the [observability primer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer).
*   Read utility class and it's usages in SR: TraceManager.java(java) `common/tracer.h/cpp (cpp)`, it's current usage(like write txn(load\/insert\/update\/delete) trace, and its propagation to BE).
*   Add your own trace
