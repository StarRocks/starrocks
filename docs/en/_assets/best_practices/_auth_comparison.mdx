| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Description            | Manually creates users in the cluster. You can associate them with external authentication systems. The user exists explicitly in the cluster. | Defines an external authentication integration. The cluster does not store any user information. You can optionally combine it with a Group Provider to define allowed users. |
| Login Process          | Users must be pre-created in the cluster. During login, the user is authenticated via StarRocks or via the configured external authentication system (for example, LDAP, JWT). Only pre-created users can log in. | Upon login, StarRocks authenticates the user using external identity systems. If succeeds, it creates a temporary, session-scoped "dummy user" internally. This user is discarded after the session ends. |
| Authorization Process  | Since users exist in the cluster, permissions can be assigned in advance using either the native authorization system or Apache Ranger. | Because users are virtual and session-based, the system cannot assign permissions in advance using native authorization. Authorization must rely on Apache Ranger. |
| Pros & Cons, Use Cases | <ul><li>**Pros**: Full flexibilityâ€”supports both native and external authorization systems.</li><li>**Cons**: Requires manual effort for creating users, which can be cumbersome.</li><li>**Recommended for**: Small user bases or cases where the cluster handles access control.</li></ul> | <ul><li>**Pros**: Easy to set up; only requires external authentication configuration and allowed group definitions.</li><li>**Cons**: Cannot use native IBAC for user-level permissions.</li><li>**Recommended for**: Large organizations with unified external authentication platforms.</li></ul> |
