You can load data into StarRocks tables only as a user who has the INSERT privilege on those StarRocks tables. If you do not have the INSERT privilege, follow the instructions provided in [GRANT](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/GRANT.md) to grant the INSERT privilege to the user that you use to connect to your StarRocks cluster. The syntax is `GRANT INSERT ON TABLE <table_name> IN DATABASE <database_name> TO { ROLE <role_name> | USER <user_identity>}`.
