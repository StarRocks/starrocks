A Delta Lake catalog is a kind of external catalog that enables you to query data from Delta Lake without ingestion.

Also, you can directly transform and load data from Delta Lake by using [INSERT INTO](../../sql-reference/sql-statements/loading_unloading/INSERT.md) based on Delta Lake catalogs. StarRocks supports Delta Lake catalogs from v2.5 onwards.

To ensure successful SQL workloads on your Delta Lake cluster, your StarRocks cluster must be able to access the storage system and metastore of your Delta Lake cluster. StarRocks supports the following storage systems and metastores:

- Distributed file system (HDFS) or object storage like AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, Google GCS, or other S3-compatible storage system (for example, MinIO)

- Metastore like Hive metastore or AWS Glue

:::note
If you choose AWS S3 as storage, you can use HMS or AWS Glue as metastore. If you choose any other storage system, you can only use HMS as metastore.
