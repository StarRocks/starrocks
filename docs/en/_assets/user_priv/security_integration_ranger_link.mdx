Please note that if you use the security integration to configure an external authentication method, you must also [integrate StarRocks with Apache Ranger](../../administration/user_privs/authorization/ranger_plugin.md) to enable external authorization. Currently, integrating Security Integration with the StarRocks native authorization is not supported.
