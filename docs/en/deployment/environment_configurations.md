# Check environment configurations

This topic lists all environment and system configuration items that you must check and set before deploying StarRocks. Setting these configuration items properly allows your StarRocks cluster to work with high availability and performance.

## Ports

StarRocks uses specific ports for different services. Check whether these ports are occupied on each instance if you have deployed other services on these instances.

### FE ports

On the instances used for the FE deployment, you need to check the following ports:

- `8030`: FE HTTP server port (`http_port`)
- `9020`: FE Thrift server port (`rpc_port`)
- `9030`: FE MySQL server port (`query_port`)
- `9010`: FE internal communication port (`edit_log_port`)

Run the following commands on the FE instances to check whether these ports are occupied:

```Bash
netstat -tunlp | grep 8030
netstat -tunlp | grep 9020
netstat -tunlp | grep 9030
netstat -tunlp | grep 9010
```

If any of the above ports are occupied, you must find alternatives and specify them later when you deploy FE nodes. For detailed instructions, see [Deploy StarRocks - Start the Leader FE node](../deployment/deploy_manually.md#step-1-start-the-leader-fe-node).

### BE ports

On the instances used for the BE deployment, you need to check the following ports:

- `9060`: BE Thrift server port (`be_port`)
- `8040`: BE HTTP server port (`be_http_port`)
- `9050`: BE heartbeat service port (`heartbeat_service_port`)
- `8060`: BE bRPC port (`brpc_port`)

Run the following commands on the BE instances to check whether these ports are occupied:

```Bash
netstat -tunlp | grep 9060
netstat -tunlp | grep 8040
netstat -tunlp | grep 9050
netstat -tunlp | grep 8060
```

If any of the above ports are occupied, you must find alternatives and specify them later when you deploy BE nodes. For detailed instructions, see [Deploy StarRocks - Start the BE service](../deployment/deploy_manually.md#step-2-start-the-be-service).

### CN ports

On the instances used for the CN deployment, you need to check the following ports:

- `9060`: CN Thrift server port (`be_port`)
- `8040`: CN HTTP server port (`be_http_port`)
- `9050`: CN heartbeat service port (`heartbeat_service_port`)
- `8060`: CN bRPC port (`brpc_port`)

Run the following commands on the CN instances to check whether these ports are occupied:

```Bash
netstat -tunlp | grep 9060
netstat -tunlp | grep 8040
netstat -tunlp | grep 9050
netstat -tunlp | grep 8060
```

If any of the above ports are occupied, you must find alternatives and specify them later when you deploy CN nodes. For detailed instructions, see [Deploy StarRocks - Start the CN service](../deployment/deploy_manually.md#step-3-optional-start-the-cn-service).

## Hostnames

If you want to [enable FQDN access](../administration/enable_fqdn.md) for your StarRocks cluster, you must assign a hostname to each instance.

In the file **/etc/hosts** on each instance, you must specify the IP addresses and corresponding hostnames of all the other instances in the cluster.

> **CAUTION**
>
> All IP addresses in the file **/etc/hosts** must be unique.

## JDK configuration

StarRocks relies on the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to locate the Java dependency on the instance.

Run the following command to check the environment variable `JAVA_HOME`:

```Bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

Follow these steps to set `JAVA_HOME`:

1. Set `JAVA_HOME` in the file **/etc/profile**:

   ```Bash
   sudo vi /etc/profile
   # Replace <path_to_JDK> with the path where JDK is installed.
   export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_JDK>
   export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
   ```

2. Bring the change into effect:

   ```Bash
   source /etc/profile
   ```

Run the following command to verify the change:

```Bash
java -version
```

## CPU scaling governor

This configuration item is **optional**. You can skip it if your CPU does not support the scaling governor.

The CPU scaling governor controls the CPU power mode. If your CPU supports it, we recommend you set it to `performance` for better CPU performance:

```Bash
echo 'performance' | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

## Memory configurations

### Memory Overcommit

Memory Overcommit allows the operating system to overcommit memory resources to processes. We recommend you enable Memory Overcommit.

```Bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
```

### Transparent Huge Pages

Transparent Huge Pages are enabled by default. We recommend you disable this feature because it can interfere with the memory allocator, and thereby lead to a drop in performance.

```Bash
echo 'madvise' | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

### Swap Space

We recommend you disable Swap Space.

Follow these steps to check and disable Swap Space:

1. Disable Swap Space.

   ```SQL
   swapoff /<path_to_swap_space>
   ```

2. Delete the Swap Space information from the configuration file **/etc/fstab**.

   ```Bash
   /<path_to_swap_space> swap swap defaults 0 0
   ```

3. Verify that Swap Space is disabled.

   ```Bash
   free -m
   ```

### Swappiness

We recommend you disable swappiness to eliminate its impact on performance.

```Bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```

## Storage configurations

We recommend that you choose your suitable scheduler algorithm in accordance with the storage medium you use.

You can run the following command to check the scheduler algorithm that you are using:

```Bash
cat /sys/block/${disk}/queue/scheduler
# For example, run cat /sys/block/vdb/queue/scheduler
```

We recommend you use the mq-deadline scheduler for SATA disks and the kyber scheduler algorithm for SSD and NVMe disks.

### SATA

The mq-deadline scheduler algorithm suits SATA disks.

Modify this item temporarily:

```Bash
echo mq-deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/${disk}/queue/scheduler
```

To make the change permanent, run the following command after you modify this item:

```Bash
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
```

### SSD and NVMe

The kyber scheduler algorithm suits NVMe or SSD disks.

Modify this item temporarily:

```Bash
echo kyber | sudo tee /sys/block/${disk}/queue/scheduler
```

If your system does not support the kyber scheduler for SSD and NVMe, we recommend you use the none (or noop) scheduler.

```Bash
echo none | sudo tee /sys/block/${disk}/queue/scheduler
```

To make the change permanent, run the following command after you modify this item:

```Bash
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
```

## SELinux

We recommend you disable SELinux.

```Bash
sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config
sed -i 's/SELINUXTYPE/#SELINUXTYPE/' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0 
```

## Firewall

Open the internal ports for FE nodes, BE nodes, and Broker if your firewall is enabled.

```Bash
systemctl stop firewalld.service
systemctl disable firewalld.service
```

## LANG variable

Run the following command to check and configure the LANG variable manually:

```Bash
echo "export LANG=en_US.UTF8" >> /etc/profile
source /etc/profile
```

## Time zone

Set this item in accordance with your actual time zone.

The following example sets the time zone to `/Asia/Shanghai`.

```Bash
cp -f /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime
hwclock
```

## ulimit configurations

Problems can occur with StarRocks if the values of **max file descriptors** and **max user processes** are abnormally small.

### Max file descriptors

You can set the maximum number of file descriptors by running the following command:

```Bash
ulimit -n 655350
```

### Max user processes

You can set the maximum number of user processes by running the following command:

```Bash
ulimit -u 40960
```

## File system configuration

We recommend you use the ext4 or xfs journaling file system. You can run the following command to check the mount type:

```Bash
df -Th
```

## Network configuration

### tcp_abort_on_overflow

Allow the system to reset new connections if the system is currently overflowed with new connection attempts that the daemon(s) can not handle:

```Bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_abort_on_overflow
```

### somaxconn

Specify the maximum number of connection requests queued for any listening socket to `1024`:

```Bash
echo 1024 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
```

## NTP configuration

You must configure time synchronization between nodes within your StarRocks cluster to ensure linear consistency of transactions. You can either use the internet time service provided by pool.ntp.org, or use the NTP service built in an offline environment. For example, you can use the NTP service provided by your cloud service provider.

1. Check if the NTP time server exists.

   ```Bash
   rpm -qa | grep ntp
   ```

2. Install the NTP service if there is not one.

   ```Bash
   sudo yum install ntp ntpdate && \
   sudo systemctl start ntpd.service && \
   sudo systemctl enable ntpd.service
   ```

3. Check the NTP service.

   ```Bash
   systemctl list-unit-files | grep ntp
   ```

4. Check the connectivity and monitoring status of the NTP service.

   ```Bash
   netstat -tlunp | grep ntp
   ```

5. Check if your application is synchronized with the NTP server.

   ```Bash
   ntpstat
   ```

6. Check the state of all the configured NTP servers in your network.

   ```Bash
   ntpq -p
   ```

## High concurrency configurations

If your StarRocks cluster has a high load concurrency, we recommend you set the following configurations:

```Bash
echo 120000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
echo 262144 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count
echo 200000 > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
```
