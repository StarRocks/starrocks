# StarRocks version 4.0

:::warning

**Downgrade Notes**

- After upgrading StarRocks to v4.0, DO NOT downgrade it directly to v3.5.0 & v3.5.1, otherwise it will cause metadata incompatibility and FE crash. You must downgrade the cluster to v3.5.2 or later to prevent these issues.
- Before downgrading clusters from v4.0.2 to v4.0.1, v4.0.0, and v3.5.2~v3.5.10, execute the following statement:

  ```SQL
  SET GLOBAL enable_rewrite_simple_agg_to_meta_scan=false;
  ```

  After upgrading the cluster back to v4.0.2 and later, execute the following statement:

  ```SQL
  SET GLOBAL enable_rewrite_simple_agg_to_meta_scan=true;
  ```

### Storage Optimization and Cluster Management

- Introduced  the File Bundling optimization for the cloud-native table in shared-data clusters to automatically bundle the data files generated by loading, Compaction, or Publish operations, thereby reducing the API cost caused by high-frequency access to the external storage system. File Bundling is enabled by default for tables created in v4.0 or later. [#58316](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/58316)
- Supports Multi-Table Write-Write Transaction to allow users to control the atomic submission of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

- Optimized the performance of the JOIN and AGG operators. [#61691](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/61691)
- [Preview] Introduced SQL Plan Manager to allow users to bind a query plan to a query, thereby preventing the query plan from changing due to system state changes (mainly data updates and statistics updates), thus stabilizing query performance. [#56310](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/56310)
- Introduced Partition-wise Spillable Aggregate/Distinct operators to replace the original Spill implementation based on sorted aggregation, significantly improving aggregation performance and reducing read/write overhead in complex and high-cardinality GROUP BY scenarios. [#60216](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/60216)
- Flat JSON V2:
  - Supports configuring Flat JSON on the table level. [#57379](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/57379)
  - Enhance JSON columnar storage by retaining the V1 mechanism while adding page- and segment-level indexes (ZoneMaps, Bloom filters), predicate pushdown with late materialization, dictionary encoding, and integration of a low-cardinality global dictionary to significantly boost execution efficiency. [#60953](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/60953)
- Supports an adaptive ZoneMap index creation strategy for the STRING data type. [#61960](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/61960)
- Enhanced query observability:
  - Optimized EXPLAIN ANALYZE output to display the execution metrics by group and by operator for better readability. [#63326](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/63326)
  - `QueryDetailActionV2` and `QueryProfileActionV2` now support JSON format, enhancing cross-FE query capabilities. [#63235](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/63235)
  - Supports retrieving Query Profile information across all FEs. [#61345](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/61345)
  - SHOW PROCESSLIST statements display Catalog, Query ID, and other information. [#62552](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/62552)
  - Enhanced query queue and process monitoring, supporting display of Running/Pending statuses.[#62261](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/62261)
- Materialized view rewrites consider the distribution and sort keys of the original table, improving the selection of optimal materialized views. [#62830](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/62830)

Adjust the metadata cache TTL to 24 hours. [#63459](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/63459) [#63373](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/63373) [#61966](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/61966) [#62288](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/62288)
- SHOW DATA DISTRIBUTION now will not merge the statistics of all materialized indexes with the same bucket sequence number. It only shows data distribution at the materialized index level. [#59656](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/59656)
- The default bucket size for automatic bucket tables is changed from 4GB to 1GB to improve performance and resource utilization. [#63168](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/63168)
