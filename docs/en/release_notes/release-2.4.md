# StarRocks version 2.4

## 2.4.5

Release date: April 21, 2023

### Improvements

- Forbade the List Partition syntax because it may cause errors in upgrading metadata. [#15401](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/15401)
- Supports BITMAP, HLL, and PERCENTILE types for materialized views. [#15731](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/15731)
- Optimized the inference of `storage_medium`. When BEs use both SSD and HDD as storage devices, if the property `storage_cooldown_time` is specified, StarRocks sets `storage_medium` to `SSD`. Otherwise, StarRocks sets `storage_medium` to `HDD`. [#18649](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18649)
- Optimized the accuracy of thread dump. [#16748](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/16748)
- Optimized load efficiency by triggering metadata compaction before loading. [#19347](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19347)
- Optimized the Stream Load planner timeout. [#18992](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18992/files)
- Optimized the Unique key table performance by forbidding the collection of statistics from value columns. [#19563](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19563)

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- NPE is returned when an unsupported data type is used in CREATE TABLE. [# 20999](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/20999)

- Wrong results are returned to queries with aggregation. [#19725](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/19725)
- No error message is returned when loading NULL parquet data into NOT NULL columns. [#19885](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19885)
- The query concurrency metric decreases slowly when the concurrency limit of a resource group is continuously reached. [#19363](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19363)
- FE fails to start when replaying the `InsertOverwriteJob` state change log. [#19061](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/19061)
- The Primary Key table deadlock. [#18488](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18488)
- For Colocation tables, the replica status can be manually specified as `bad` by using statements like `ADMIN SET REPLICA STATUS PROPERTIES ("tablet_id" = "10003", "backend_id" = "10001", "status" = "bad");`. If the number of BEs is less than or equal to the number of replicas, the corrupted replica cannot be repaired. [#17876](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/17876)
- Issues caused by ARRAY-related functions. [#18556](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18556)

## 2.4.0

Release date: October 20, 2022

### New Features

- Supports creating asynchronous materialized views based on multiple base tables to accelerate queries with JOIN operations. Asynchronous materialized views support all [table types](../table_design/table_types/table_types.md). For more information, see [Materialized View](../using_starrocks/Materialized_view.md).

- Supports overwriting data via INSERT OVERWRITE. For more information, see [Load data using INSERT](../loading/InsertInto.md).

- [Preview] Provides stateless Compute Nodes (CN) that can be horizontally scaled. You can use StarRocks Operator to deploy CN into your Kubernetes (K8s) cluster to achieve automatic horizontal scaling. For more information, see [Deploy and manage CN on Kubernetes with StarRocks Operator](../deployment/sr_operator.md).

- Outer Join supports non-equi joins in which join items are related by comparison operators including `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `<>`. For more information, see [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SELECT.md).

- Supports creating Iceberg catalogs and Hudi catalogs, which allow direct queries on data from Apache Iceberg and Apache Hudi. For more information, see [Iceberg catalog](../data_source/catalog/iceberg_catalog.md) and [Hudi catalog](../data_source/catalog/hudi_catalog.md).

- Supports querying ARRAY-type columns from Apache Hive™ tables in CSV format. For more information, see [External table](../data_source/External_table.md).

- Supports viewing the schema of external data via DESC. For more information, see [DESC](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Utility/DESCRIBE.md).

- Supports granting a specific role or IMPERSONATE permission to a user via GRANT and revoking them via REVOKE, and supports executing an SQL statement with IMPERSONATE permission via  EXECUTE AS. For more information, see [GRANT](../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/GRANT.md), [REVOKE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/REVOKE.md), and [EXECUTE AS](../sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/EXECUTE_AS.md).

- Supports FDQN access: now you can use domain name or the combination of hostname and port as the unique identification of a BE or an FE node. This prevents access failures caused by changing IP addresses. For more information, see [Enable FQDN Access](../administration/enable_fqdn.md).

- flink-connector-starrocks supports Primary Key table partial update. For more information, see [Load data by using flink-connector-starrocks](../loading/Flink-connector-starrocks.md).

- Provides the following new functions:

  - array_contains_all: checks whether a specific array is a subset of another. For more information, see [array_contains_all](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_contains_all.md).
  - percentile_cont: calculates the percentile value with linear interpolation. For more information, see [percentile_cont](../sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/percentile_cont.md).

### Improvements

- The Primary Key table supports flushing VARCHAR-type primary key indexes to disks. From version 2.4.0, the Primary Key table supports the same data types for primary key indexes regardless of whether persistent primary key index is turned on or not.

- Optimized the query performance on external tables.

  - Supports late materialization during queries on external tables in Parquet format to optimize the query performance on data lakes with small-scale filtering involved.
  - Small I/O operations can be merged to reduce the delay for querying data lakes, thereby improving the query performance on external tables.

- Optimized the performance of window functions.

- Optimized the performance of Cross Join by supporting predicate pushdown.

- Histograms are added to CBO statistics. Full statistics collection is further optimized. For more information, see [Gather CBO statistics](../using_starrocks/Cost_based_optimizer.md).

- Adaptive multi-threading is enabled for tablet scanning to reduce the dependency of scanning performance on the tablet number. As a result, you can set the number of buckets more easily. For more information, see [Determine the number of buckets](../table_design/Data_distribution.md#how-to-determine-the-number-of-buckets).

- Supports querying compressed TXT files in Apache Hive.

- Adjusted the mechanisms of default PageCache size calculation and memory consistency check to avoid OOM issues during multi-instance deployments.

- Improved the performance of large-size batch load on Primary Key tables up to two times by removing final_merge operations.

- Supports a Stream Load transaction interface to implement two-phase commit (2PC) for transactions that are run to load data from external systems such as Apache Flink® and Apache Kafka®, improving the performance of highly concurrent stream loads.

- Functions:

  - You can use multiple COUNT(DISTINCT) in one statement. For more information, see [count](../sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/count.md).
  - Window functions min() and max() support sliding windows. For more information, see [Window functions](../sql-reference/sql-functions/Window_function.md).
  - Optimized the performance of the window_funnel function. For more information, see [window_funnel](../sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/window_funnel.md).
