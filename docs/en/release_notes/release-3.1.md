# StarRocks version 3.1

## 3.1.11

Release date: April 28, 2024

### Behavior Changes

- Users are not allowed to drop views in the system database `information_schema` using DROP TABLE. [#43556](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43556)
- Users are not allowed to specify duplicate keys in the ORDER BY clause when creating a Primary Key table. [#43374](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43374)

### Improvements

- Queries on Parquet-formatted Iceberg v2 tables support equality deletes.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- When a user queries data from an external table in an external catalog, access to this table is denied even when the user has the SELECT privilege on this table. SHOW GRANTS also shows that the user has this privilege. [#44061](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/44061)
- `str_to_map` may cause BEs to crash. [#43930](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43930)
- When a Routine Load job is going on, running `show proc '/routine_loads'` is stuck due to deadlock. [#44249](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/44249)
- Persistent Index of Primary Key tables may cause BEs to crash due to issues in concurrency control. [#43720](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43720)
- The `pending_task_run_count` displayed on the page of `leaderFE_IP:8030` is incorrect. The displayed number is the sum of Pending and Running tasks, not Pending tasks. In addition, the information of the metric `refresh_pending` cannot be displayed using `followerFE_IP:8030`. [#43052](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43052)
- Querying `information_schema.task_runs` fails frequently. [#43052](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/43052)
- Some SQL queries that contain CTEs may encounter the `Invalid plan: PhysicalTopNOperator` error. [#44185](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/44185)

## 3.1.10 (Yanked)

:::tip

This version has been taken offline due to privilege issues in querying external tables in external catalogs such as Hive and Iceberg.

- **Problem**: When a user queries data from an external table in an external catalog, access to this table is denied even when the user has the SELECT privilege on this table. SHOW GRANTS also shows that the user has this privilege.

- **Impact scope**: This problem only affects queries on external tables in external catalogs. Other queries are not affected.

- **Temporary workaround**: The query succeeds after the SELECT privilege on this table is granted to the user again. But `SHOW GRANTS` will return duplicate privilege entries. After an upgrade to v3.1.11, users can run `REVOKE` to remove one of the privilege entries.

:::

Release date: March 29, 2024

### New Features

- Primary Key tables support Size-tiered Compaction. [#42474](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42474)

### Behavior Changes

- When null values in JSON data are evaluated based on the `IS NULL` operator, they are considered NULL values following SQL language. For example, `true` is returned for `SELECT parse_json('{"a": null}') -> 'a' IS NULL` (before this behavior change, `false` is returned). [#42815](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42815)

### Improvements

- When Broker Load is used to load data from ORC files that contain TIMESTAMP-type data, StarRocks supports retaining microseconds in the timestamps when converting the timestamps to match its own DATETIME data type. [#42348](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42348)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- In shared-data mode, the garbage collection and thread eviction mechanisms for handling persistent indexes created on Primary Key tables cannot take effect on CN nodes. As a result, obsolete data cannot be deleted. [#42241](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42241)
- When users query ORC files by using Hive catalogs, the query results may be incorrect because StarRocks used to read ORC files from Hive based on mapping by position. To resolve this issue, users can set the session variable `orc_use_column_names` to `true`, which specifies to read ORC files from Hive based on mapping by column name. [#42905](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42905)
- When LDAP authentication for the AD system is adopted, logins without passwords are allowed. [#42476](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42476)
- When disk device names end with digits, the values of monitoring metrics remain 0s because the disk device names may be invalid after such digits are removed. [#42741](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42741)

## 3.1.9

Release date: March 8, 2024

### New Features

- Cloud-native Primary Key tables in shared-data clusters support Size-tiered Compaction to reduce write I/O amplification for the loading of a large number of small-sized files. [#41610](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41610)
- Added the function `regexp_extract_all`. [#42178](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42178)
- Added the view `information_schema.partitions_meta`, which records detailed metadata of partitions. [#41101](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41101)
- Added the view `sys.fe_memory_usage`, which records the memory usage for StarRocks. [#41083](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41083)

### Behavior Changes

- The logic of dynamic partitioning is changed. Now partition columns of the DATE type do not support hour-level data. Note that partition columns of the DATETIME type still support hour-level data. [#40328](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40328)
- The user who can refresh materialized views is changed from the `root` user to the user who creates the materialized views. This change does not affect existing materialized views. [#40698](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40698)
- By default, when comparing columns of constant and string types, StarRocks compares them as strings. Users can use the session variable `cbo_eq_base_type` to adjust the default rule used for the comparison. For example, users can set `cbo_eq_base_type` to `decimal`, and StarRocks then compares the columns as numeric values. [#41712](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41712)

### Improvements

- StarRocks supports using the parameter `s3_compatible_fs_list` to specify which S3-compatible object storage can be accessed via AWS SDK, and supports using the parameter `fallback_to_hadoop_fs_list` to specify non-S3-compatible object storage that require access via HDFS Schema (this method necessitates the use of vendor-provided JAR packages). [#41612](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41612)
- The compatibility with Trino's SQL statement syntax is optimized to support converting the following functions of Trino: `current_catalog`, `current_schema`, `to_char`, `from_hex`, `to_date`, `to_timestamp`, and `index`. [#41505](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41505) [#41270](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41270) [#40838](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40838)
- A new session variable `cbo_materialized_view_rewrite_related_mvs_limit` is added to control the maximum number of candidate materialized views allowed during query planning. The default value of this session variable is `64`. This session variable helps mitigate the excessive resource consumption caused by a large number of candidate materialized views for a query during the query planning. [#39829](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39829)
- The `agg_type` of BITMAP-type columns in an Aggregate table can be set to `replace_if_not_null` to support updates only to a few columns of the table. [#42102](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/42102)
- The session variable `cbo_eq_base_type` is optimized to support specifying the implicit conversion rule applied to the comparison of data that contains both string and numeric data types. By default, such data is compared as strings. [#40619](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41712)
- More DATE-type data (for example, "%Y-%m-%e %H:%i") can be recognized to better support partition expressions for Iceberg tables. [#40474](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40474)
- The JDBC connector supports the TIME data type. [#31940](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31940)
- The `path` parameter in the SQL statement for creating a file external table supports wildcards (`*`). However, like the `DATA INFILE` parameter in the SQL statement for creating a Broker Load job, the `path` parameter supports using wildcards (`*`) to match at most one level of directory or file. [#40844](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40844)
- A new internal SQL log file is added to record log data related to statistics and materialized views. [#40682](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40682)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- "Analyze Error" is thrown if inconsistent letter cases are assigned to the names or aliases of tables or views queried in the creation of a Hive view. [#40921](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40921)
- I/O usage reaches the upper limit if persistent indexes are created on Primary Key tables. [#39959](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39959)
- In shared-data clusters, the primary key index directory is deleted every 5 hours. [#40745](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40745)
- After a table for which list partitioning is enabled is truncated or its partitions are truncated, queries based on the partitioning keys of the table return no data. [#40495](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40495)
- After users execute ALTER TABLE COMPACT by hand, the memory usage statistics for compaction operations are abnormal. [#41150](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/41150)
- During data migration between clusters, if only some columns are updated in column mode, the destination cluster may crash. [#40692](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40692)
- The SQL blacklist may not take effect if the submitted SQL statement contains multiple spaces or newline characters. [#40457](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/40457)

## 3.1.8

Release date: February 5, 2024

### New Features

- StarRocks Community provides the StarRocks Cross-cluster Data Migration Tool, which supports migrating data from a shared-nothing cluster to either another shared-nothing cluster or a shared-data cluster.
- Supports creating synchronous materialized views with the WHERE clause specified.
- Added metrics that show memory usage of the data cache to MemTracker. [#39600](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39600)

### Parameter Change

- Added a BE configuration item, `lake_pk_compaction_max_input_rowsets`, which controls the maximum number of input rowsets allowed in a Primary Key table compaction task in a shared-data StarRocks cluster. This helps optimize resource consumption for compaction tasks. [#39611](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39611)

### Improvements

- Supports ORDER BY and INDEX clauses in CTAS statements. [#38886](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38886)
- Supports equality deletes on ORC-formatted Iceberg v2 tables. [#37419](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37419)
- Supports setting the `datacache.partition_duration` property for cloud-native tables created with the list partitioning strategy. This property controls the validity period of the data cache and can be dynamically configured. [#35681](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35681) [#38509](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38509)
- Optimized the BE configuration item `update_compaction_per_tablet_min_interval_seconds`. This parameter is originally used only to control the frequency of compaction tasks on Primary Key tables. After the optimization, it can also be used to control the frequency of major compaction tasks on Primary Key table indexes. [#39640](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39640)
- Parquet Reader supports converting INT32-type data in Parquet-formatted data to DATETIME-type data and storing the resulting data to StarRocks. [#39808](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/39808)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- Using NaN (Not a Number) columns as ORDER BY columns may cause BEs to crash. [#30759](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30759)
- Failure to update primary key indexes may cause the error "get_applied_rowsets failed". [#27488](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/27488)
- The resources occupied by compaction_state_cache are not recycled after compaction task failures. [#38499](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38499)
- If partition columns in external tables contain null values, queries against those tables will cause BEs to crash. [#38888](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38888)
- After a table is dropped and then re-created with the same table name, refreshing asynchronous materialized views created on that table fails. [#38008](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38008)
- Refreshing asynchronous materialized views created on empty Iceberg tables fail. [#24068](https://starrocks.atlassian.net/browse/SR-24068)

## 3.1.7

Release date: January 12, 2024

### New Features

- Added a new function, `unnest_bitmap`. [#38136](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38136)
- Supports conditional updates for [Broker Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/3.1/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD/#opt_properties). [#37400](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37400)

### Behavior Change

- Added the session variable `enable_materialized_view_for_insert`, which controls whether materialized views rewrite the queries in INSERT INTO SELECT statements. The default value is `false`. [#37505](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37505)
- The FE dynamic parameter `enable_new_publish_mechanism` is changed to a static parameter. You must restart the FE after you modify the parameter settings. [#35338](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35338)
- Added the session variable `enable_strict_order_by`. When this variable is set to the default value `TRUE`, an error is reported for such a query pattern: Duplicate alias is used in different expressions of the query and this alias is also a sorting field in ORDER BY, for example, `select distinct t1.* from tbl1 t1 order by t1.k1;`. The logic is the same as that in v2.3 and earlier. When this variable is set to `FALSE`, a loose deduplication mechanism is used, which processes such queries as valid SQL queries. [#37910](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37910)

### Parameter Change

- Added the FE configuration item `routine_load_unstable_threshold_second`. [#36222](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36222)
- Added the FE configuration item `http_worker_threads_num`, which specifies the number of threads for HTTP server to deal with HTTP requests. The default value is `0`. If the value for this parameter is set to a negative value or `0`, the actual thread number is twice the number of CPU cores. [#37530](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37530)
- Added the BE configuration item `pindex_major_compaction_limit_per_disk` to configure the maximum concurrency of compaction on a disk. This addresses the issue of uneven I/O across disks due to compaction. This issue can cause excessively high I/O for certain disks. The default value is `1`. [#36681](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36681)
- Added session variables `transaction_read_only` and `tx_read_only` to specify the transaction access mode, which are compatible with MySQL versions 5.7.20 and above. [#37249](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37249)
- Added the FE configuration item `default_mv_refresh_immediate`, which specifies whether to immediately refresh the materialized view after the materialized view is created. The default value is `true`. [#37093](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37093)
- Added a new BE configuration item `lake_enable_vertical_compaction_fill_data_cache`, which specifies whether to allow compaction tasks to cache data on local disks in a shared-data cluster. The default value is `false`. [#37296](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37296)

### Improvements

- INSERT INTO FILE() SELECT FROM supports reading BINARY-type data from tables and exporting the data to Parquet-formatted files in remote storage. [#36797](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36797)
- Asynchronous materialized views support dynamically setting the `datacache.partition_duration` property, which controls the validity period of the hot data in the data cache. [#35681](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35681)
- Wen using JDK, the default GC algorithm is G1. [#37386](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37386)
- The `date_trunc`, `adddate`, and `time_slice` functions support setting the `interval` parameter to values that are accurate to the millisecond and microsecond. [#36386](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36386)
- When the string on the right side of the LIKE operator within the WHERE clause does not include `%` or `_`, the LIKE operator is converted into the `=` operator. [#37515](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37515)
- A new field `LatestSourcePosition` is added to the return result of [SHOW ROUTINE LOAD](https://docs.starrocks.io/zh/docs/3.1/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_ROUTINE_LOAD/) to record the position of the latest message in each partition of the Kafka topic, helping check the latencies of data loading. [#38298](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38298)
- Added a new resource group property, `spill_mem_limit_threshold`, to control the memory usage threshold (percentage) at which a resource group triggers the spilling of intermediate results when the system variable `spill_mode` is set to `auto`. The valid range is (0, 1). The default value is `1`, indicating the threshold does not take effect. [#37707](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37707)
- The result returned by the [SHOW ROUTINE LOAD](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/3.1/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_ROUTINE_LOAD/) statement now includes the timestamps of consumption messages from each partition. [#36222](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36222)
- The scheduling policy for Routine Load is optimized, so that slow tasks do not block the execution of the other normal tasks. [#37638](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37638)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- The execution of [ANALYZE TABLE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/3.1/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/ANALYZE_TABLE/) gets stuck occasionally. [#36836](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36836)
- The memory consumption by PageCache exceeds the threshold specified by the BE dynamic parameter `storage_page_cache_limit` in certain circumstances. [#37740](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37740)
- Hive metadata in [Hive catalogs](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/3.1/data_source/catalog/hive_catalog/) is not automatically refreshed when new fields are added to Hive tables. [#37668](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37668)
- In some cases, `bitmap_to_string` may return incorrect results due to data type overflow. [#37405](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37405)
- Executing the DELETE statement on an empty table returns "ERROR 1064 (HY000): Index: 0, Size: 0". [#37461](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37461)
- When the FE dynamic parameter `enable_sync_publish` is set to `TRUE`, queries on data that is written after the BEs crash and then restart may fail. [#37398](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37398)
- The value of the `TABLE_CATALOG` field in `views` of the StarRocks Information Schema is `null`. [#37570](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37570)
- When `SELECT ... FROM ... INTO OUTFILE` is executed to export data into CSV files, the error "Unmatched number of columns" is reported if the FROM clause contains multiple constants. [#38045](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/38045)

## 3.1.6

Release date: December 18, 2023

### New Features

- Added the [now(p)](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/now/) function to return the current date and time with the specified fractional seconds precision (accurate to the microsecond). If `p` is not specified, this function returns only date and time accurate to the second. [#36676](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36676)
- Added a new metric `max_tablet_rowset_num` for setting the maximum allowed number of rowsets. This metric helps detect possible compaction issues and thus reduces the occurrences of the error "too many versions". [#36539](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36539)
- Supports obtaining heap profiles by using a command line tool, making troubleshooting easier.[#35322](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35322)
- Supports creating asynchronous materialized views with common table expressions (CTEs). [#36142](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36142)
- Added the following bitmap functions: [subdivide_bitmap](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/bitmap-functions/subdivide_bitmap/), [bitmap_from_binary](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/bitmap-functions/bitmap_from_binary/), and [bitmap_to_binary](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/bitmap-functions/bitmap_to_binary/). [#35817](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35817) [#35621](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35621)
- Optimized the logic used to compute compaction scores for Primary Key tables, thereby aligning the compaction scores for Primary Key tables within a more consistent range with the other three table types. [#36534](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36534)

### Parameter Change

- The default retention period of trash files is changed to 1 day from the original 3 days. [#37113](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/37113)
- A new BE configuration item `enable_stream_load_verbose_log` is added. The default value is `false`. With this parameter set to `true`, StarRocks can record the HTTP requests and responses for Stream Load jobs, making troubleshooting easier. [#36113](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36113)
- A new BE configuration item `enable_lazy_delta_column_compaction` is added. The default value is `true`, indicating that StarRocks does not perform frequent compaction operations on delta columns. [#36654](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36654)
- A new FE configuration item `enable_mv_automatic_active_check` is added to control whether the system automatically checks and re-activates the asynchronous materialized views that are set inactive because their base tables (views) had undergone Schema Change or had been dropped and re-created. The default value is `true`. [#36463](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36463)

### Improvements

- A new value option `GROUP_CONCAT_LEGACY` is added to the session variable [sql_mode](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/reference/System_variable/#sql_mode) to provide compatibility with the implementation logic of the [group_concat](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/string-functions/group_concat/) function in versions earlier than v2.5. [#36150](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36150)
- The Primary Key table size returned by the [SHOW DATA](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_DATA/) statement includes the sizes of **.cols** files (these are files related to partial column updates and generated columns) and persistent index files. [#34898](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34898)
- Queries on MySQL external tables and the external tables within JDBC catalogs support including keywords in the WHERE clause. [#35917](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35917)
- Plugin loading failures will no longer cause an error or cause an FE start failure. Instead, the FE can properly start, and the error status of the plug-in can be queried using [SHOW PLUGINS](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/SHOW_PLUGINS/). [#36566](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36566)
- Dynamic partitioning supports random distribution. [#35513](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35513)
- The result returned by the [SHOW ROUTINE LOAD](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_ROUTINE_LOAD/) statement provides a new field `OtherMsg`, which shows information about the last failed task. [#35806](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35806)
- The authentication information `aws.s3.access_key` and `aws.s3.access_secret` for AWS S3 in Broker Load jobs are hidden in audit logs. [#36571](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36571)
- The `be_tablets` view in the `information_schema` database provides a new field `INDEX_DISK`, which records the disk usage (measured in bytes) of persistent indexes [#35615](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35615)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- The BEs crash if users create persistent indexes in the event of data corruption. [#30841](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30841)
- If users create an asynchronous materialized view that contains nested queries, the error "resolve partition column failed" is reported. [#26078](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/26078)
- If users create an asynchronous materialized view on a base table whose data is corrupted, the error "Unexpected exception: null" is reported. [#30038](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30038)
- If users run a query that contains a window function, the SQL error "[1064] [42000]: Row count of const column reach limit: 4294967296" is reported. [#33561](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33561)
- The FE performance plunges after the FE configuration item `enable_collect_query_detail_info` is set to `true`. [#35945](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35945)
- In the StarRocks shared-data mode, the error "Reduce your request rate" may be reported when users attempt to delete files from object storage. [#35566](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35566)
- Deadlocks may occur when users refresh materialized views. [#35736](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35736)
- After the DISTINCT window operator pushdown feature is enabled, errors are reported if SELECT DISTINCT operations are performed on the complex expressions of the columns computed by window functions. [#36357](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36357)
- The BEs crash if the source data file is in ORC format and contains nested arrays. [#36127](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36127)
- Some S3-compatible object storage returns duplicate files, causing the BEs to crash. [#36103](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36103)
- The [array_distinct](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_distinct/) function occasionally causes the BEs to crash. [#36377](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/36377)
- Global Runtime Filter may cause BEs to crash in certain scenarios. [#35776](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35776)

## 3.1.5

Release date: November 28, 2023

### New features

- The CN nodes of a StarRocks shared-data cluster now support data export. [#34018](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34018)

### Improvements

- The [`COLUMNS`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/reference/information_schema/columns/) view in the system database `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` can display ARRAY, MAP, and STRUCT columns. [#33431](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33431)
- Supports queries against Parquet, ORC, and CSV formatted files that are compressed by using LZO and stored in [Hive](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/data_source/catalog/hive_catalog/). [#30923](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30923)  [#30721](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30721)
- Supports updates onto the specified partitions of an automatically partitioned table. If the specified partitions do not exist, an error is returned. [#34777](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34777)
- Supports automatic refresh of materialized views when Swap, Drop, or Schema Change operations are performed on the tables and views (including the other tables and materialized views associated with these views) on which these materialized views are created. [#32829](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32829)
- Optimized the performance of some Bitmap-related operations, including:
  - Optimized nested loop joins. [#340804](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34804)  [#35003](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35003)
  - Optimized the `bitmap_xor` function. [#34069](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34069)
  - Supports Copy on Write to optimize Bitmap performance and reduce memory consumption. [#34047](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34047)

### Bug Fixes

- When `show proc '/current_queries';` is being executed and meanwhile a query begins to be executed, BEs may crash. [#34316](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34316)
- Errors may be thrown if large amounts of data are loaded into a Primary Key table with persistent index enabled. [#34352](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34352)
- After StarRocks is upgraded from v2.4 or earlier to a later version, compaction scores may rise unexpectedly. [#34618](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34618)
- If `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is queried by using the database driver MariaDB ODBC, the `CATALOG_NAME` column returned in the `schemata` view holds only `null` values. [#34627](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34627)
- FEs crash due to the abnormal data loaded and cannot restart. [#34590](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34590)
- If schema changes are being executed while a Stream Load job is in the **PREPARED** state, a portion of the source data to be loaded by the job is lost. [#34381](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34381)
- Including two or more slashes (`/`) at the end of the HDFS storage path causes the backup and restore of the data from HDFS to fail. [#34601](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34601)
- Setting the session variable `enable_load_profile` to `true` makes Stream Load jobs prone to fail. [#34544](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34544)

### Parameter Change

#### FE/BE Parameters

- Added an FE configuration item [`enable_statistics_collect_profile`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/FE_configuration#enable_statistics_collect_profile), which controls whether to generate profiles for statistics queries. The default value is `false`. [#33815](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33815)
- The FE configuration item [`mysql_server_version`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/FE_configuration#mysql_server_version) is now mutable. The new setting can take effect for the current session without requiring an FE restart. [#34033](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34033)
- Added a BE/CN configuration item [`update_compaction_ratio_threshold`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/BE_configuration#update_compaction_ratio_threshold), which controls the maximum proportion of data that a compaction can merge for a Primary Key table in a StarRocks shared-data cluster. The default value is `0.5`. We recommend shrinking this value if a single tablet becomes excessively large. For a StarRocks shared-nothing cluster, the proportion of data that a compaction can merge for a Primary Key table is still automatically adjusted. [#35129](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/35129)

#### System Variables

- Added a session variable `cbo_decimal_cast_string_strict`, which controls how the CBO converts data from the DECIMAL type to the STRING type. If this variable is set to `true`, the logic built in v2.5.x and later versions prevails and the system implements strict conversion (namely, the system truncates the generated string and fills 0s based on the scale length). If this variable is set to `false`, the logic built in versions earlier than v2.5.x prevails and the system processes all valid digits to generate a string. The default value is `true`. [#34208](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34208)
- Added a session variable `cbo_eq_base_type`, which specifies the data type used for data comparison between DECIMAL-type data and STRING-type data. The default value is `VARCHAR`, and `DECIMAL` is also a valid value. [#34208](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/34208)
- Added a session variable `big_query_profile_second_threshold`. When the session variable [`enable_profile`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/reference/System_variable#enable_profile) is set to `false` and the amount of time taken by a query exceeds the threshold specified by the `big_query_profile_second_threshold` variable, a profile is generated for that query. [#33825](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33825)

## 3.1.4

Release date: November 2, 2023

### New Features

- Supports sort keys for Primary Key tables created in shared-data StarRocks clusters.
- Supports using the str2date function to specify partition expressions for asynchronous materialized views. This helps facilitate incremental updates and query rewrites of asynchronous materialized views created on tables that reside in external catalogs and use the STRING-type data as their partitioning expressions. [#29923](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29923) [#31964](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31964)
- Added a new session variable `enable_query_tablet_affinity`, which controls whether to direct multiple queries against the same tablet to a fixed replica. This session variable is set to `false` by default. [#33049](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33049)
- Added the utility function `is_role_in_session`, which is used to check whether the specified roles are activated in the current session. It supports checking nested roles granted to a user. [#32984](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32984)
- Supports setting resource group-level query queue, which is controlled by the global variable `enable_group_level_query_queue` (default value: `false`). When the global-level or resource group-level resource consumption reaches a predefined threshold, new queries are placed in queue, and will be run when both the global-level resource consumption and the resource group-level resource consumption fall below their thresholds.
  - Users can set `concurrency_limit` for each resource group to limit the maximum number of concurrent queries allowed per BE.
  - Users can set `max_cpu_cores` for each resource group to limit the maximum CPU consumption allowed per BE.
- Added two parameters, `plan_cpu_cost_range` and `plan_mem_cost_range`, for resource group classifiers.
  - `plan_cpu_cost_range`: the CPU consumption range estimated by the system. The default value `NULL` indicates no limit is imposed.
  - `plan_mem_cost_range`: the memory consumption range estimated by the system. The default value `NULL` indicates no limit is imposed.

### Improvements

- Window functions COVAR_SAMP, COVAR_POP, CORR, VARIANCE, VAR_SAMP, STD, and STDDEV_SAMP now support the ORDER BY clause and Window clause. [#30786](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30786)
- An error instead of NULL is returned if a decimal overflow occurs during queries on the DECIMAL type data. [#30419](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30419)
- The number of concurrent queries allowed in a query queue is now managed by the leader FE. Each follower FE notifies of the leader FE when a query starts and finishes. If the number of concurrent queries reaches the global-level or resource group-level `concurrency_limit`, new queries are rejected or placed in queue.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- Spark or Flink may report data read errors due to inaccurate memory usage statistics. [#30702](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30702)  [#30751](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30751)
- Memory usage statistics for Metadata Cache are inaccurate. [#31978](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31978)
- BEs crash when libcurl is invoked. [#31667](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31667)
- When StarRocks materialized views created on Hive views are refreshed, an error "java.lang.ClassCastException: com.starrocks.catalog.HiveView cannot be cast to com.starrocks.catalog.HiveMetaStoreTable" is returned. [#31004](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31004)
- If the ORDER BY clause contains aggregate functions, an error "java.lang.IllegalStateException: null" is returned. [#30108](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30108)
- In shared-data StarRocks clusters, the information of table keys is not recorded in `information_schema.COLUMNS`. As a result, DELETE operations cannot be performed when data is loaded by using Flink Connector. [#31458](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/31458)
- When data is loaded by using Flink Connector, the load job is suspended unexpectedly if there are highly concurrent load jobs and both the number of HTTP threads and the number of Scan threads have reached their upper limits. [#32251](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32251)
- When a field of only a few bytes is added, executing SELECT COUNT(*) before the data change finishes returns an error that reads "error: invalid field name". [#33243](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33243)
- Query results are incorrect after the query cache is enabled. [#32781](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32781)
- Queries fail during hash joins, causing BEs to crash. [#32219](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32219)
- `DATA_TYPE` and `COLUMN_TYPE` for BINARY or VARBINARY data types are displayed as `unknown` in the `information_schema.columns` view. [#32678](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/32678)

### Behavior Change

- From v3.1.4 onwards, persistent indexing is enabled by default for Primary Key tables created in new StarRocks clusters (this does not apply to existing StarRocks clusters whose versions are upgraded to v3.1.4 from an earlier version). [#33374](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/33374)
- A new FE parameter `enable_sync_publish` which is set to `true` by default is added. When this parameter is set to `true`, the Publish phase of a data load into a Primary Key table returns the execution result only after the Apply task finishes. As such, the data loaded can be queried immediately after the load job returns a success message. However, setting this parameter to `true` may cause data loads into Primary Key tables to take a longer time. (Before this parameter is added, the Apply task is asynchronous with the Publish phase.) [#27055](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/27055)

## 3.1.3

Release date: September 25, 2023

### New Features

- Primary Key tables created in shared-data StarRocks clusters support index persistence onto local disks in the same way as they do in shared-nothing StarRocks clusters.
- The aggregate function [group_concat](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/string-functions/group_concat/) supports the DISTINCT keyword and the ORDER BY clause. [#28778](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28778)
- [Stream Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/STREAM_LOAD/), [Broker Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD/), [Kafka Connector](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/Kafka-connector-starrocks/), [Flink Connector](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/Flink-connector-starrocks/), and [Spark Connector](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/Spark-connector-starrocks/) support partial updates in column mode on a Primary Key table. [#28288](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28288)
- Data in partitions can be automatically cooled down over time. (This feature is not supported for [list partitioning](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/table_design/list_partitioning/).) [#29335](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29335) [#29393](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29393)

### Improvements

Executing SQL commands with invalid comments now returns results consistent with MySQL. [#30210](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30210)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- If the [BITMAP](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/other-data-types/BITMAP/) or [HLL](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/other-data-types/HLL/) data type is specified in the WHERE clause of a [DELETE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/DELETE/) statement to be executed, the statement cannot be properly executed. [#28592](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28592)
- After a follower FE is restarted, CpuCores statistics are not up-to-date, resulting in query performance degradation. [#28472](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28472) [#30434](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30434)
- The execution cost of the [to_bitmap()](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/bitmap-functions/to_bitmap/) function is incorrectly calculated. As a result, an inappropriate execution plan is selected for the function after materialized views are rewritten. [#29961](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29961)
- In certain use cases of the shared-data architecture, after a follower FE is restarted, queries submitted to the follower FE return an error that reads "Backend node not found. Check if any backend node is down". [#28615](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28615)
- If data is continuously loaded into a table that is being altered by using the [ALTER TABLE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/ALTER_TABLE/) statement, an error "Tablet is in error state" may be thrown. [#29364](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29364)
- Modifying the FE dynamic parameter `max_broker_load_job_concurrency` using the `ADMIN SET FRONTEND CONFIG` command does not take effect. [#29964](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29964) [#29720](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29720)
- BEs crash if the time unit in the [date_diff()](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/date_diff/) function is a constant but the dates are not constants. [#29937](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/29937)
- In the shared-data architecture, automatic partitioning does not take effect after asynchronous load is enabled. [#29986](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/29986)
- If users create a Primary Key table by using the [CREATE TABLE LIKE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/CREATE_TABLE_LIKE/) statement, an error `Unexpected exception: Unknown properties: {persistent_index_type=LOCAL}` is thrown. [#30255](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30255)
- Restoring Primary Key tables causes metadata inconsistency after BEs are restarted. [#30135](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30135)
- If users load data into a Primary Key table on which truncate operations and queries are concurrently performed, an error "java.lang.NullPointerException" is thrown in certain cases. [#30573](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30573)
- If predicate expressions are specified in materialized view creation statements, the refresh results of those materialized views are incorrect. [#29904](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29904)
- After users upgrade their StarRocks cluster to v3.1.2, the storage volume properties of the tables created before the upgrade are reset to `null`. [#30647](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30647)
- If checkpointing and restoration are concurrently performed on tablet metadata, some tablet replicas will be lost and cannot be retrieved. [#30603](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30603)
- If users use CloudCanal to load data into table columns that are set to `NOT NULL` but have no default value specified, an error "Unsupported dataFormat value is : \N" is thrown. [#30799](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/30799)

### Behavior Change

- When using the [group_concat](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/string-functions/group_concat/) function, users must use the SEPARATOR keyword to declare the separator.
- The default value of the session variable [`group_concat_max_len`](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/reference/System_variable#group_concat_max_len) which controls the default maximum length of the string returned by the [group_concat](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/string-functions/group_concat/) function is changed from unlimited to `1024`.

## 3.1.2

Release date: August 25, 2023

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- If a user specifies which database is to be connected by default and the user only has permissions on tables in the database but does not have permissions on the database, an error stating that the user does not have permissions on the database is thrown. [#29767](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29767)
- The values returned by the RESTful API action `show_data` for cloud-native tables are incorrect. [#29473](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29473)
- BEs crash if queries are canceled while the [array_agg()](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_agg/) function is being run. [#29400](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/29400)
- The `Default` field values returned by the [SHOW FULL COLUMNS](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_FULL_COLUMNS/) statement for columns of the [BITMAP](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/other-data-types/BITMAP/) or [HLL](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/other-data-types/HLL/) data type are incorrect. [#29510](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29510)
- If the [array_map()](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_map/) function in queries involves multiple tables, the queries fail due to pushdown strategy issues. [#29504](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29504)
- Queries against ORC-formatted files fail because the bugfix ORC-1304 ([apache/orc#1299](https://github.com/apache/orc/pull/1299)) from Apache ORC is not merged. [#29804](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/29804)

### Behavior Change

For a newly deployed StarRocks v3.1 cluster, you must have the USAGE privilege on the destination external catalog if you want to run [SET CATALOG](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/SET_CATALOG/) to switch to that catalog. You can use [GRANT](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/GRANT/) to grant the required privileges.

For a v3.1 cluster upgraded from an earlier version, you can run SET CATALOG with inherited privilege.

## 3.1.1

Release date: August 18, 2023

### New Features

- Supports Azure Blob Storage for [shared-data clusters](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/deployment/shared_data/s3/).
- Supports List partitioning for [shared-data clusters](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/deployment/shared_data/s3/).
- Supports aggregate functions [COVAR_SAMP](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/covar_samp/), [COVAR_POP](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/covar_pop/), and [CORR](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/corr/).
- Supports the following [window functions](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-functions/Window_function/): COVAR_SAMP, COVAR_POP, CORR, VARIANCE, VAR_SAMP, STD, and STDDEV_SAMP.

### Improvements

Supports implicit conversions for all compound predicates and for all expressions in the WHERE clause. You can enable or disable implicit conversions by using the [session variable](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/reference/System_variable/) `enable_strict_type`. The default value of this session variable is `false`.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- When data is loaded into tables that have multiple replicas, a large number of invalid log records are written if some partitions of the tables are empty.  [#28824](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/28824)
- Inaccurate estimation of average row size causes partial updates in column mode on Primary Key tables to occupy excessively large memory.  [#27485](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/27485)
- If clone operations are triggered on tablets in an ERROR state, disk usage increases. [#28488](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28488)
- Compaction causes cold data to be written to the local cache. [#28831](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28831)

## 3.1.0

Release date: August 7, 2023

### New Features

#### Shared-data cluster

- Added support for Primary Key tables, on which persistent indexes cannot be enabled.
- Supports the [AUTO_INCREMENT](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/auto_increment/) column attribute, which enables a globally unique ID for each data row and thus simplifies data management.
- Supports [automatically creating partitions during loading and using partitioning expressions to define partitioning rules](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/table_design/expression_partitioning/), thereby making partition creation easier to use and more flexible.
- Supports [abstraction of storage volumes](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/deployment/shared_data/s3#use-your-shared-data-starrocks-cluster), in which users can configure storage location and authentication information, in shared-data StarRocks clusters. Users can directly reference an existing storage volume when creating a database or table, making authentication configuration easier.

#### Data Lake analytics

- Supports accessing views created on tables within [Hive catalogs](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/data_source/catalog/hive_catalog/).
- Supports accessing Parquet-formatted Iceberg v2 tables.
- Supports [sinking data to Parquet-formatted Iceberg tables](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/data_source/catalog/iceberg_catalog#sink-data-to-an-iceberg-table).
- [Preview] Supports accessing data stored in Elasticsearch by using [Elasticsearch catalogs](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/data_source/catalog/elasticsearch_catalog/). This simplifies the creation of Elasticsearch external tables.
- [Preview] Supports performing analytics on streaming data stored in Apache Paimon by using [Paimon catalogs](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/data_source/catalog/paimon_catalog/).

#### Storage engine, data ingestion, and query

- Upgraded automatic partitioning to [expression partitioning](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/table_design/expression_partitioning/). Users only need to use a simple partition expression (either a time function expression or a column expression) to specify a partitioning method at table creation, and StarRocks will automatically create partitions based on the data characteristics and the rule defined in the partition expression during data loading. This method of partition creation is suitable for most scenarios and is more flexible and user-friendly.
- Supports [list partitioning](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/table_design/list_partitioning/). Data is partitioned based on a list of values predefined for a particular column, which can accelerate queries and manage clearly categorized data more efficiently.
- Added a new table named `loads` to the `Information_schema` database. Users can query the results of [Broker Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD/) and [Insert](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/INSERT/) jobs from the `loads` table.
- Supports logging the unqualified data rows that are filtered out by [Stream Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/STREAM_LOAD/), [Broker Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/BROKER_LOAD/), and [Spark Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SPARK_LOAD/) jobs. Users can use the `log_rejected_record_num` parameter in their load job to specify the maximum number of data rows that can be logged.
- Supports [random bucketing](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/table_design/Data_distribution#how-to-choose-the-bucketing-columns). With this feature, users do not need to configure bucketing columns at table creation, and StarRocks will randomly distribute the data loaded into it to buckets. Using this feature together with the capability of automatically setting the number of buckets (`BUCKETS`) that StarRocks has provided since v2.5.7, users no longer need to consider bucket configurations, and table creation statements are greatly simplified. In big data and high performance-demanding scenarios, however, we recommend that users continue using hash bucketing, because this way they can use bucket pruning to accelerate queries.
- Supports using the table function FILES() in [INSERT INTO](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/InsertInto/) to directly load the data of Parquet- or ORC-formatted data files stored in AWS S3. The FILES() function can automatically infer the table schema, which relieves the need to create external catalogs or file external tables before data loading and therefore greatly simplifies the data loading process.
- Supports [generated columns](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/generated_columns/). With the generated column feature, StarRocks can automatically generate and store the values of column expressions and automatically rewrite queries to improve query performance.
- Supports loading data from Spark to StarRocks by using [Spark connector](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/Spark-connector-starrocks/). Compared to [Spark Load](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/loading/SparkLoad/), the Spark connector provides more comprehensive capabilities. Users can define a Spark job to perform ETL operations on the data, and the Spark connector serves as the sink in the Spark job.
- Supports loading data into columns of the [MAP](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/semi_structured/Map/) and [STRUCT](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/data-types/semi_structured/STRUCT/) data types, and supports nesting Fast Decimal values in ARRAY, MAP, and STRUCT.

#### SQL reference

- Added the following storage volume-related statements: [CREATE STORAGE VOLUME](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/CREATE_STORAGE_VOLUME/), [ALTER STORAGE VOLUME](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/ALTER_STORAGE_VOLUME/), [DROP STORAGE VOLUME](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/DROP_STORAGE_VOLUME/), [SET DEFAULT STORAGE VOLUME](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/SET_DEFAULT_STORAGE_VOLUME/), [DESC STORAGE VOLUME](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/DESC_STORAGE_VOLUME/), [SHOW STORAGE VOLUMES](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/SHOW_STORAGE_VOLUMES/).

Added [privilege items](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/privilege_item#storage-volume) related to storage volumes and [privilege items](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/privilege_item#catalog) related to external catalogs, and supports using [GRANT](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/GRANT/) and [REVOKE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/account-management/REVOKE/) to grant and revoke these privileges.

### Improvements

#### Shared-data cluster

Optimized the data cache in shared-data StarRocks clusters. The optimized data cache allows for specifying the range of hot data. It can also prevent queries against cold data from occupying the local disk cache, thereby ensuring the performance of queries against hot data.

#### Materialized view

- Optimized the creation of an asynchronous materialized view:
  - Supports random bucketing. If users do not specify bucketing columns, StarRocks adopts random bucketing by default.
  - Supports using `ORDER BY` to specify a sort key.
  - Supports specifying attributes such as `colocate_group`, `storage_medium`, and `storage_cooldown_time`.
  - Supports using session variables. Users can configure these variables by using the `properties("session.<variable_name>" = "<value>")` syntax to flexibly adjust view refreshing strategies.
  - Enables the spill feature for all asynchronous materialized views and implements a query timeout duration of 1 hour by default.
  - Supports creating materialized views based on views. This makes materialized views easier to use in data modeling scenarios, because users can flexibly use views and materialized views based on their varying needs to implement layered modeling.
- Optimized query rewrite with asynchronous materialized views:
  - Supports Stale Rewrite, which allows materialized views that are not refreshed within a specified time interval to be used for query rewrite regardless of whether the base tables of the materialized views are updated. Users can specify the time interval by using the `mv_rewrite_staleness_second` property at materialized view creation.
  - Supports rewriting View Delta Join queries against materialized views that are created on Hive catalog tables (a primary key and a foreign key must be defined).
  - Optimized the mechanism for rewriting queries that contain union operations, and supports rewriting queries that contain joins or functions such as COUNT DISTINCT and time_slice.
- Optimized the refreshing of asynchronous materialized views:
  - Optimized the mechanism for refreshing materialized views that are created on Hive catalog tables. StarRocks now can perceive partition-level data changes, and refreshes only the partitions with data changes during each automatic refresh.
  - Supports using the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW WITH SYNC MODE` syntax to synchronously invoke materialized view refresh tasks.
- Enhanced the use of asynchronous materialized views:
  - Supports using `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW {ACTIVE | INACTIVE}` to enable or disable a materialized view. Materialized views that are disabled (in the `INACTIVE` state) cannot be refreshed or used for query rewrite, but can be directly queried.
  - Supports using `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SWAP WITH` to swap two materialized views. Users can create a new materialized view and then perform an atomic swap with an existing materialized view to implement schema changes on the existing materialized view.
- Optimized synchronous materialized views:
  - Supports direct queries against synchronous materialized views using SQL hints `[_SYNC_MV_]`, allowing for walking around issues that some queries cannot be properly rewritten in rare circumstances.
  - Supports more expressions, such as `CASE-WHEN`, `CAST`, and mathematical operations, which make materialized views suitable for more business scenarios.

#### Data Lake analytics

- Optimized metadata caching and access for Iceberg to improve Iceberg data query performance.
- Optimized the data cache to further improve data lake analytics performance.

#### Storage engine, data ingestion, and query

- Announced the general availability of the [spill](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/spill_to_disk/) feature, which supports spilling the intermediate computation results of some blocking operators to disk. With the spill feature enabled, when a query contains aggregate, sort, or join operators, StarRocks can cache the intermediate computation results of the operators to disk to reduce memory consumption, thereby minimizing query failures caused by memory limits.
- Supports pruning on cardinality-preserving joins. If users maintain a large number of tables which are organized in the star schema (for example, SSB) or the snowflake schema (for example, TCP-H) but they query only a small number of these tables, this feature helps prune unnecessary tables to improve the performance of joins.
- Supports partial updates in column mode. Users can enable the column mode when they perform partial updates on Primary Key tables by using the [UPDATE](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/UPDATE/) statement. The column mode is suitable for updating a small number of columns but a large number of rows, and can improve the updating performance by up to 10 times.
- Optimized the collection of statistics for the CBO. This reduces the impact of statistics collection on data ingestion and increases statistics collection performance.
- Optimized the merge algorithm to increase the overall performance by up to 2 times in permutation scenarios.
- Optimized the query logic to reduce dependency on database locks.
- Dynamic partitioning further supports the partitioning unit to be year. [#28386](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/28386)

#### SQL reference

- Conditional functions case, coalesce, if, ifnull, and nullif support the ARRAY, MAP, STRUCT, and JSON data types.
- The following Array functions support nested types MAP, STRUCT, and ARRAY:
  - array_agg
  - array_contains, array_contains_all, array_contains_any
  - array_slice, array_concat
  - array_length, array_append, array_remove, array_position
  - reverse, array_distinct, array_intersect, arrays_overlap
  - array_sortby
- The following Array functions support the Fast Decimal data type:
  - array_agg
  - array_append, array_remove, array_position, array_contains
  - array_length
  - array_max, array_min, array_sum, array_avg
  - arrays_overlap, array_difference
  - array_slice, array_distinct, array_sort, reverse, array_intersect, array_concat
  - array_sortby, array_contains_all, array_contains_any

### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following issues:

- Requests to reconnect to Kafka for Routine Load jobs cannot be properly processed. [#23477](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/23477)
- For SQL queries that involve multiple tables and contain a `WHERE` clause, if these SQL queries have the same semantics but the order of the tables in each SQL query is different, some of these SQL queries may fail to be rewritten to benefit from the related materialized views. [#22875](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/22875)
- Duplicate records are returned for queries that contain a `GROUP BY` clause. [#19640](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/19640)
- Invoking the lead() or lag() function may cause BE crashes. [#22945](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/22945)
- Rewriting partial partition queries based on materialized views that are created on external catalog tables fail. [#19011](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/19011)
- SQL statements that contain both a backward slash (`\`) and a semicolon (`;`) cannot be properly parsed. [#16552](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/16552)
- A table cannot be truncated if a materialized view created on the table is removed. [#19802](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/19802)

### Behavior Change

- The `storage_cache_ttl` parameter is deleted from the table creation syntax used for shared-data StarRocks clusters. Now the data in the local cache is evicted based on the LRU algorithm.
- The BE configuration items `disable_storage_page_cache` and `alter_tablet_worker_count` and the FE configuration item `lake_compaction_max_tasks` are changed from immutable parameters to mutable parameters.
- The default value of the BE configuration item `block_cache_checksum_enable` is changed from `true` to `false`.
- The default value of the BE configuration item `enable_new_load_on_memory_limit_exceeded` is changed from `false` to `true`.
- The default value of the FE configuration item `max_running_txn_num_per_db` is changed from `100` to `1000`.
- The default value of the FE configuration item `http_max_header_size` is changed from `8192` to `32768`.
- The default value of the FE configuration item `tablet_create_timeout_second` is changed from `1` to `10`.
- The default value of the FE configuration item `max_routine_load_task_num_per_be` is changed from `5` to `16`, and error information will be returned if a large number of Routine Load tasks are created.
- The FE configuration item `quorom_publish_wait_time_ms` is renamed as `quorum_publish_wait_time_ms`, and the FE configuration item `async_load_task_pool_size` is renamed as `max_broker_load_job_concurrency`.
- The BE configuration item `routine_load_thread_pool_size` is deprecated. Now the routine load thread pool size per BE node is controlled only by the FE configuration item `max_routine_load_task_num_per_be`.
- The BE configuration item `txn_commit_rpc_timeout_ms` and the system variable `tx_visible_wait_timeout` are deprecated.
- The FE configuration items `max_broker_concurrency` and `load_parallel_instance_num` are deprecated.
- The FE configuration item `max_routine_load_job_num` is deprecated. Now StarRocks dynamically infers the maximum number of Routine Load tasks supported by each individual BE node based on the `max_routine_load_task_num_per_be` parameter and provides suggestions on task failures.
- The CN configuration item `thrift_port` is renamed as `be_port`.
- Two new Routine Load job properties, `task_consume_second` and `task_timeout_second`, are added to control the maximum amount of time to consume data and the timeout duration for individual load tasks within a Routine Load job, making job adjustment more flexible. If users do not specify these two properties in their Routine Load job, the FE configuration items `routine_load_task_consume_second` and `routine_load_task_timeout_second` prevail.
- The session variable `enable_resource_group` is deprecated because the [Resource Group](https://docs.starrocks.io/docs/administration/resource_group/) feature is enabled by default since v3.1.0.
- Two new reserved keywords, COMPACTION and TEXT, are added.
