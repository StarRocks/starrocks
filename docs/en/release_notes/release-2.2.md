## 2.2.1

Release date: June 2, 2022

### Improvements

- Added the CPU and memory usage information of the machines on which BEs are deployed for each query to the FE audit log. [#6208](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6208) [#6209](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6209)
- Supported JSON data types in the tables that use the Primary Key model and tables that use the Unique Key model. [#6544](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6544)
- Reduced FEs load by reducing lock granularity and deduplicating BE report requests. Optimized the report performance when a large number of BEs are deployed, and solved the issue of Routine Load tasks getting stuck in a large cluster. [#6293](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6293)

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- An error occurs when StarRocks parses the escape characters specified in the `SHOW FULL TABLES FROM DatabaseName` statement. [#6559](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/6559)
- FE disk space usage rises sharply (Fix this bug by rolling back the BDBJE version). [#6708](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6708)
- BEs become faulty because relevant fields cannot be found in the data returned after columnar scanning is enabled (`enable_docvalue_scan=true`). [#6600](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/6600)

## 2.2.0

Release date: May 22, 2022

### New Features

- [Preview] The resource group management feature is released. This feature allows StarRocks to isolate and efficiently use CPU and memory resources when StarRocks processes both complex queries and simple queries from different tenants in the same cluster.

- [Preview] A Java-based user-defined function (UDF) framework is implemented. This framework supports UDFs that are compiled in compliance with the syntax of Java to extend the capabilities of StarRocks.

- [Preview] The primary key model supports updates only to specific columns when data is loaded to the primary key model in real-time data update scenarios such as order updates and multi-stream joins.

- [Preview] JSON data types and JSON functions are supported.

- External tables can be used to query data from Apache Hudi. This further improves users' data lake analytics experience with StarRocks. For more information, see [External tables](../data_source/External_table.md).

- The following functions are added:
  - ARRAY functions: [array_agg](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_agg.md), array_sort, array_distinct, array_join, reverse, array_slice, array_concat, array_difference, arrays_overlap, and array_intersect

  - BITMAP functions: bitmap_max and bitmap_min
  - Other functions: retention and square

### Improvements

- The parser and analyzer of the cost-based optimizer (CBO) are restructured, the code structure is optimized, and syntaxes such as INSERT with Common Table Expression (CTE) are supported. These improvements are made to increase the performance of complex queries, such as queries that involve the reuse of CTEs.

- The performance of queries on Apache Hiveâ„¢ external tables that are stored in cloud object storage services such as AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), and Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) is optimized. After the optimization, the performance of object storage-based queries is comparable to that of HDFS-based queries. Additionally, late materialization of ORC files is supported, and queries on small files are accelerated. For more information, see [Apache Hiveâ„¢ external table](../data_source/External_table.md).

- When queries from Apache Hiveâ„¢ are run by using external tables, StarRocks automatically performs incremental updates to the cached metadata by consuming Hive metastore events such as data changes and partition changes. StarRocks also supports queries on data of the DECIMAL and ARRAY types from Apache Hiveâ„¢. For more information, see [Apache Hiveâ„¢ external table](../data_source/External_table.md).

- The UNION ALL operator is optimized to run 2 to 25 times faster than before.

- A pipeline engine that supports adaptive parallelism and provides optimized profiles is released to improve the performance of simple queries in high concurrency scenarios.

- Multiple characters can be combined and used as a single row delimiter for CSV files that are to be imported.

### Bug Fixes

- Deadlocks occur if data is loaded or changes are committed into tables that are based on the primary key model. [#4998](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/4998)

- Frontends (FEs), including FEs that run Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition (BDB JE), are unstable. [#4428](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/4428), [#4666](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/4666), [#2](https://github.com/StarRocks/bdb-je/pull/2)

- The result that is returned by the SUM function encounters an arithmetic overflow if the function is invoked on a large amount of data. [#3944](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/3944)

- The precision of the results that are returned by the ROUND and TRUNCATE functions is unsatisfactory. [#4256](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/4256)

- A few bugs are detected by Synthesized Query Lancer (SQLancer). For more information, see [SQLancer-related issues](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues?q=is:issue++label:sqlancer++milestone:2.2).

### Others

Flink-connector-starrocks supports Apache FlinkÂ® v1.14.

### Upgrade notes

- If you use a StarRocks version later than 2.0.4 or a StarRocks version 2.1.x later than 2.1.6, see [Upgrade notes for StarRocks](https://forum.starrocks.com/t/topic/2228).

- To roll back to the previous version that was used before the upgrade, add the `ignore_unknown_log_id` parameter to the **fe.conf** file of each FE and set the parameter to `true`. The parameter is required because new types of logs are added in StarRocks v2.2.0. If you do not add the parameter, you cannot roll back to the previous version. We recommend that you set the `ignore_unknown_log_id` parameter to `false` in the **fe.conf** file of each FE after checkpoints are created. Then, restart the FEs to restore the FEs to the previous configurations.
