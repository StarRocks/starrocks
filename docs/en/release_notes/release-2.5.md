## 2.5.5

Release date: April 28, 2023

### New features

Added a metric to monitor the tablet status of Primary Key tables:

- Added the FE metric `err_state_metric`.
- Added the `ErrorStateTabletNum` column to the output of `SHOW PROC '/statistic/'` to display the number of **err_state** tablets.
- Added the `ErrorStateTablets` column to the output of `SHOW PROC '/statistic/<db_id>/'` to display the IDs of **err_state** tablets.

For more information, see [SHOW PROC](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/SHOW_PROC.md).

### Improvements

- Optimized the disk balancing speed when multiple BEs are added. [# 19418](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19418)
- Optimized the inference of `storage_medium`. When BEs use both SSD and HDD as storage devices, if the property `storage_cooldown_time` is specified, StarRocks sets `storage_medium` to `SSD`. Otherwise, StarRocks sets `storage_medium` to `HDD`. [#18649](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18649)
- Optimized the performance of Unique Key tables by forbidding the collection of statistics from value columns. [#19563](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19563)

### Bug Fixes

- For Colocation tables, the replica status can be manually specified as `bad` by using statements like `ADMIN SET REPLICA STATUS PROPERTIES ("tablet_id" = "10003", "backend_id" = "10001", "status" = "bad");`. If the number of BEs is less than or equal to the number of replicas, the corrupted replica cannot be repaired. [# 17876](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/17876)
- After a BE is started, its process exists but the BE port cannot be enabled. [# 19347](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19347)

- The issue caused by using window_funnel() with the Query Cache feature. [# 21474](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/21474)
- Optimization plan selection takes an unexpectedly long time after the CTE is rewritten. [# 16515](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/16515)

## 2.5.4

Release date: April 4, 2023

### Improvements

- Optimized the performance of rewriting queries on materialized views during query planning. The amount of time taken for query planning is reduced by about 70%. [#19579](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19579)
- Optimized the type inference logic. If a query like `SELECT sum(CASE WHEN XXX);` contains a constant `0`, such as `SELECT sum(CASE WHEN k1 = 1 THEN v1 ELSE 0 END) FROM test;`, pre-aggregation is automatically enabled to accelerate the query. [#19474](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19474)
- Supports using `SHOW CREATE VIEW` to view the creation statement of a materialized view. [#19999](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19999)

- Supports using [SHOW CREATE CATALOG](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_CREATE_CATALOG.md) to query the creation statement of an external catalog.

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- After queries on materialized views are rewritten, the global dictionary for low-cardinality optimization does not take effect. [#19615](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19615)
- If a query on materialized views fails to be rewritten, the query fails. [#19774](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19774)
- If a materialized view is created based on a Primary Key or Unique Key table, queries on that materialized view cannot be rewritten. [#19600](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19600)
- The column names of materialized views are case-sensitive. However, when you create a table, the table is successfully created without an error message even if column names are incorrect in the `PROPERTIES` of the table creation statement, and moreover the rewriting of queries on materialized views created on that table fails. [#19780](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19780)
- After a query on materialized views is rewritten, the query plan ma contain partition column-based, invalid predicates, which affect query performance. [#19784](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19784)
- When data is loaded into a newly created partition, queries on materialized views may fail to be rewritten. [#20323](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/20323)
- Configuring `"storage_medium" = "SSD"` at the creation of materialized views causes the refresh of the materialized views to fail. [#19539](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19539) [#19626](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19626)
- Concurrent compaction may happen on Primary Key tables. [#19692](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19692)
- Compaction does not occur promptly after a large number of DELETE operations. [#19623](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/19623)
- If the expression of a statement contains multiple low-cardinality columns, the expression may fail to be properly rewritten. As a result, the global dictionary for low-cardinality optimization does not take effect. [#20161](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/20161)

## 2.5.3

Release date: March 10, 2023

### Improvements

  - Supports rewriting queries with Outer Join and Cross Join. [#18629](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18629)
  - Optimized the data scan logic for MVs, further accelerating the rewritten queries. [#18629](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18629)
  - Enhanced rewrite capabilities for single-table aggregate queries.  [#18629](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18629)
  - Enhanced rewrite capabilities in View Delta scenarios, which is when the queried tables are a subset of the MV's base tables. [#18800](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18800)
- Optimized the performance and memory usage when the window function RANK() is used as a filter or a sort key. [#17553](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/17553)

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- Errors caused by null literals `[]` in ARRAY data. [#18563](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18563)
- Misuse of the low-cardinality optimization dictionary in some complex query scenarios. The dictionary mapping check is now added before applying the dictionary.  [#17318](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17318)
- In a single BE environment, Local Shuffle causes GROUP BY to produce duplicate results. [#17845](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17845)
- Misuses of partition-related PROPERTIES for a non-partitioned MV may cause the MV refresh to fail. The partition PROPERTIES check is now performed when users create an MV. [#18741](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18741)
- Errors in parsing Parquet Repetition columns. [#17626](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17626) [#17788](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17788) [#18051](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18051)
- The obtained column's nullable information is incorrect. Solution: When CTAS is used to create a Primary Key table, only the primary key columns are non-nullable; non-primary key columns are nullable. [#16431](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/16431)
- Some issues caused by deleting data from Primary Key tables.  [#18768](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/18768)

- Apache Hive external tables that contain MAP and ARRAY data cannot be refreshed. [#17548](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17548)
- Superset cannot identify column types of materialized views. [#17686](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17686)
- BI connectivity fails because SET GLOBAL/SESSION TRANSACTION cannot be parsed. [#17295](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17295)
- The bucket number of dynamic partitioned tables in a Colocate Group cannot be modified and an error message is returned. [#17418](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17418/)
- Potential issues caused by a failure in the Prepare stage. [#17323](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/17323)

### Behavior Change

- Allows users to specify a collection period for automatic CBO statistics collection, which prevents cluster performance jitter caused by automatic full collection. [#14996](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14996)
- Added Thrift server queue. Requests that cannot be processed immediately during INSERT INTO SELECT can be pending in the Thrift server queue, preventing requests from being rejected. [#14571](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14571)
- Deprecated the FE parameter `default_storage_medium`. If `storage_medium` is not explicitly specified when users create a table, the system automatically infers the storage medium of the table based on BE disk type. For more information, see description of `storage_medium` in [CREATE TABLE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/CREATE_VIEW.md). [#14394](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14394)

- Optimized the following aspects of materialized views:
  - Asynchronous materialized views support automatic and transparent query rewrite based on the SPJG-type materialized views. For more information, see [Materialized view](../using_starrocks/Materialized_view.md#rewrite-and-accelerate-queries-with-the-asynchronous-materialized-view). [#13193](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/13193)
  - Asynchronous materialized views support multiple async refresh mechanisms. For more information, see [Materialized view](../using_starrocks/Materialized_view.md#manually-refresh-an-asynchronous-materialized-view).

[#10138](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/10138)
  - Broker Load and Spark Load no longer need to depend on brokers for data loading when only one HDFS cluster or one Kerberos user is configured. However, if you have multiple HDFS clusters or multiple Kerberos users, you still need to deploy a broker. For more information, see [Load data from HDFS or cloud storage](../loading/BrokerLoad.md) and [Bulk load using Apache Spark™](../loading/SparkLoad.md). [#9049](https://github.com/starrocks/starrocks/pull/9049) [#9228](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/9228)

- Optimized the following functions:
  - Added an optional parameter for the [time_slice](../sql-reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/time_slice.md) function, which is used to determine whether the beginning or end of the time interval is returned. [#11216](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/11216)
  - Added a new mode `INCREASE` for the [window_funnel](../sql-reference/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/window_funnel.md) function to avoid computing duplicate timestamps. [#10134](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/10134)
  - Supports specifying multiple arguments in the [unnest](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/unnest.md) function. [#12484](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/12484)

  - The following ARRAY functions support querying JSON data: [array_agg](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_agg.md), [array_sort](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_sort.md), [array_concat](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_concat.md), [array_slice](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/array_slice.md), and [reverse](../sql-reference/sql-functions/array-functions/reverse.md). [#13155](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/13155)
  - Optimized the use of some functions. The `current_date`, `current_timestamp`, `current_time`, `localtimestamp`, and `localtime` functions can be executed without using `()`, for example, you can directly run `select current_date;`. [# 14319](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14319)
- Removed some redundant information from FE logs. [# 15374](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/15374)

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- The append_trailing_char_if_absent() function may return an incorrect result when the first argument is empty. [#13762](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/13762)
- After a table is restored using the RECOVER statement, the table does not exist. [#13921](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/13921)
- The result returned by the SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statement does not contain the database and catalog specified in the query statement when the materialized view was created. [#12833](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/12833)
- Schema change jobs in the `waiting_stable` state cannot be canceled. [#12530](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/12530)
- Running the `SHOW PROC '/statistic';` command on a Leader FE and non-Leader FE returns different results. [#12491](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues/12491)
- The position of the ORDER BY clause is incorrect in the result returned by SHOW CREATE TABLE. [# 13809](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/13809)
- When users use Hive Catalog to query Hive data, if the execution plan generated by FE does not contain partition IDs, BEs fail to query Hive partition data. [# 15486](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/15486).

### Behavior Change

- Changed the default value of the `AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED` parameter to `False`, which means that the metadata of Amazon EC2 is obtained to access AWS resources.
- Renamed session variable `is_report_success` to `enable_profile`, which can be queried using the SHOW VARIABLES statement.
- Added four reserved keywords: `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, `LOCALTIME`, and `LOCALTIMESTAMP`. [# 14319](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14319)
- The maximum length of table and database names can be up to 1023 characters. [# 14929](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/14929) [# 15020](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pull/15020)
- BE configuration items `enable_event_based_compaction_framework` and `enable_size_tiered_compaction_strategy` are set to `true` by default, which significantly reduces compaction overheads when there are a large number of tablets or a single tablet has large data volume.

### Upgrade Notes

- You can upgrade your cluster to 2.5.0 from 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, or 2.4.x. However, if you need to perform a rollback, we recommend that you roll back only to 2.4.x.
