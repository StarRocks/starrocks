# Query rewrite with materialized views

This topic describes how to leverage StarRocks' asynchronous materialized views to rewrite and accelerate queries.

## Overview

StarRocks' asynchronous materialized view uses a widely adopted transparent query rewrite algorithm based on the SPJG (select-project-join-group-by) form. Without the need to modify the query statement, StarRocks can automatically rewrite queries against the base tables into queries against the corresponding materialized view that contains the pre-computed results. As a result, materialized views can help you significantly reduce computational costs, and substantially accelerate query execution.

The query rewrite feature based on asynchronous materialized views is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **Pre-aggregation of metrics**

  You can use materialized views to create a pre-aggregated metric layer if you are dealing with a high dimensionality of data.

- **Joins of wide tables**

  Materialized views allow you to transparently accelerate queries with joins of multiple large wide tables in complex scenarios.

- **Query acceleration in the data lake**

  Building an external catalog-based materialized view can easily accelerate queries against data in your data lake.

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > Asynchronous materialized views created on base tables in a JDBC catalog do not support query rewrite.

### Features

StarRocks' asynchronous materialized view-based automatic query rewrite features the following attributes:

- **Strong data consistency**: If the base tables are native tables, StarRocks ensures that the results obtained through the materialized view-based query rewrite are consistent with the results returned from the direct query against the base tables.
- **Staleness rewrite**: StarRocks supports staleness rewrite, allowing you to tolerate a certain level of data expiration to cope with scenarios with frequent data changes.
- **Multi-table joins**: StarRocks' asynchronous materialized view supports various types of joins, including some complex join scenarios like View Delta Joins and Derivable Joins, allowing you to accelerate queries in scenarios involving large wide tables.
- **Aggregation rewrite**: StarRocks can rewrite queries with aggregations to improve report performance.
- **Nested materialized view**: StarRocks supports rewriting complex queries based on nested materialized views, expanding the scope of queries that can be rewritten.
- **Union rewrite**: You can combine the Union rewrite feature with the TTL (Time-to-Live) of the materialized view's partitions to achieve the separation of the hot and cold data, which allows you to query hot data from materialized views and historical data from the base table.
- **Materialized views on views**: You can accelerate the queries in scenarios with data modeling based on views.
- **Materialized views on external catalogs**: You can accelerate queries in data lakes.
- **Complex expression rewrite**: It can handle complex expressions, including function calls and arithmetic operations, catering to advanced analytical and calculation requirements.

These features will be elaborated in the following sections.

## Join rewrite

StarRocks supports rewriting queries with various types of joins, including Inner Join, Cross Join, Left Outer Join, Full Outer Join, Right Outer Join, Semi Join, and Anti Join.

The following is an example of rewriting queries with joins. Create two base tables as follows:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE customer (
  c_custkey     INT(11)     NOT NULL,
  c_name        VARCHAR(26) NOT NULL,
  c_address     VARCHAR(41) NOT NULL,
  c_city        VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL,
  c_nation      VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  c_region      VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL,
  c_phone       VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  c_mktsegment  VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(c_custkey)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(c_custkey) BUCKETS 12;

CREATE TABLE lineorder (
  lo_orderkey         INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_linenumber       INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_custkey          INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_partkey          INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_suppkey          INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_orderdate        INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_orderpriority    VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  lo_shippriority     INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_quantity         INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_extendedprice    INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_ordtotalprice    INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_discount         INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_revenue          INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_supplycost       INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_tax              INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_commitdate       INT(11) NOT NULL,
  lo_shipmode         VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(lo_orderkey)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(lo_orderkey) BUCKETS 48;
```

With the above base tables, you can create a materialized view as follows:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv1
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, lo_partkey, c_name, c_address
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
```

Such a materialized view can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_name, c_address
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
```

![Rewrite-1](../assets/Rewrite-1.png)

StarRocks supports rewriting join queries with complex expressions, such as arithmetic operations, string functions, date functions, CASE WHEN expressions, and OR predicates. For example, the above materialized view can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
SELECT 
    lo_orderkey, 
    lo_linenumber, 
    (2 * lo_revenue + 1) * lo_linenumber, 
    upper(c_name), 
    substr(c_address, 3)
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
```

In addition to the conventional scenario, StarRocks further supports rewriting join queries in more complicated scenarios.

### Query Delta Join rewrite

Query Delta Join refers to a scenario in which the tables joined in a query are a superset of the tables joined in a materialized view. For instance, consider the following query that involves joins of three tables: `lineorder`, `customer`, and `part`. If the materialized view `join_mv1` contains only the join of `lineorder` and `customer`, StarRocks can rewrite the query using `join_mv1`.

Example:

```SQL
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_name, c_address, p_name
FROM
    lineorder INNER JOIN customer ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
    INNER JOIN part ON lo_partkey = p_partkey;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

### View Delta Join rewrite

View Delta Join refers to a scenario in which the tables joined in a query are a subset of the tables joined in a materialized view. This feature is typically used in scenarios involving large wide tables. For example, in the context of the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB), you can create a materialized view that joins all tables to improve query performance. Through testing, it has been found that query performance for multi-table joins can achieve the same level of performance as querying the corresponding large wide table after transparently rewriting the queries through the materialized view.

To perform a View Delta Join rewrite, the materialized view must contain the 1:1 cardinality preservation join that does not exist in the query. Here are the nine types of joins that are considered cardinality preservation joins, and satisfying any one of them enables View Delta Join rewriting:

![Rewrite-3](../assets/Rewrite-3.png)

Take SSB tests as an example, create the following base tables:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE customer (
  c_custkey         INT(11)       NOT NULL,
  c_name            VARCHAR(26)   NOT NULL,
  c_address         VARCHAR(41)   NOT NULL,
  c_city            VARCHAR(11)   NOT NULL,
  c_nation          VARCHAR(16)   NOT NULL,
  c_region          VARCHAR(13)   NOT NULL,
  c_phone           VARCHAR(16)   NOT NULL,
  c_mktsegment      VARCHAR(11)   NOT NULL
) ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(c_custkey)

"unique_constraints" = "c_custkey"   -- Specify the unique constraints.

CREATE TABLE dates (
  d_datekey          DATE          NOT NULL,
  d_date             VARCHAR(20)   NOT NULL,

SSB Q2.1 involves joining four tables, but it lacks the `customer` table compared to the materialized view `lineorder_flat_mv`. In `lineorder_flat_mv`, `lineorder INNER JOIN customer` is essentially a cardinality preservation join. Therefore, logically, this join can be eliminated without affecting the query results. As a result, Q2.1 can be rewritten using `lineorder_flat_mv`.

SSB Q2.1:

```SQL
SELECT sum(lo_revenue) AS lo_revenue, d_year, p_brand
FROM lineorder
JOIN dates ON lo_orderdate = d_datekey
JOIN part ON lo_partkey = p_partkey
JOIN supplier ON lo_suppkey = s_suppkey
WHERE p_category = 'MFGR#12' AND s_region = 'AMERICA'
GROUP BY d_year, p_brand
ORDER BY d_year, p_brand;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

![Rewrite-4](../assets/Rewrite-4.png)

Similarly, other queries in the SSB can also be transparently rewritten using `lineorder_flat_mv`, thus optimizing query performance.

### Join Derivability rewrite

Join Derivability refers to a scenario in which the join types in the materialized view and the query are not consistent, but the materialized view's join results contain the results of the query's join. Currently, it supports two scenarios - joining three or more tables, and  joining two tables.

- **Scenario one: Joining three or more tables**

  Suppose the materialized view contains a Left Outer Join between tables `t1` and `t2` and an Inner Join between tables `t2` and `t3`. In both joins, the join condition includes columns from `t2`.

  The query, on the other hand, contains an Inner Join between t1 and t2, and an Inner Join between t2 and t3. In both joins, the join condition includes columns from t2.

  In this case, the query can be rewritten using the materialized view. This is because in the materialized view, the Left Outer Join is executed first, followed by the Inner Join. The right table generated by the Left Outer Join has no results for the matching (that is, columns in the right table are NULL). These results are subsequently filtered out during the Inner Join. Therefore, the logic of the materialized view and the query is equivalent, and the query can be rewritten.

  Example:

  Create the materialized view `join_mv5`:

  ```SQL
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv5
  PARTITION BY lo_orderdate
  DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
  PROPERTIES (
    "partition_refresh_number" = "1"
  )
  AS
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_orderdate, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address, p_name
  FROM customer LEFT OUTER JOIN lineorder
  ON c_custkey = lo_custkey
  INNER JOIN part
  ON p_partkey = lo_partkey;
  ```

  `join_mv5` can rewrite the following query:

  ```SQL
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_orderdate, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address, p_name
  FROM customer INNER JOIN lineorder
  ON c_custkey = lo_custkey
  INNER JOIN part
  ON p_partkey = lo_partkey;
  ```

  Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

  ![Rewrite-5](../assets/Rewrite-5.png)

  Similarly, if the materialized view is defined as `t1 INNER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3`, and the query is `LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 INNER JOIN t3`, the query can also be rewritten. Furthermore, this rewriting capability extends to scenarios involving more than three tables.

- **Scenario two: Joining two tables**

  The Join Derivability Rewrite feature involving two tables supports the following specific cases:

  ![Rewrite-6](../assets/Rewrite-6.png)

  In cases 1 to 9, filtering predicates must be added to the rewritten result to ensure semantic equivalence. For example, create a materialized view as follows:

  ```SQL
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv3
  DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
  AS
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address
  FROM lineorder LEFT OUTER JOIN customer
  ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
  ```

  The following query can be rewritten using `join_mv3`, and the predicate `c_custkey IS NOT NULL` is added to the rewritten result:

  ```SQL
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address
  FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
  ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
  ```

  Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

  ![Rewrite-7](../assets/Rewrite-7.png)

  In case 10, the Left Outer Join query must include the filtering predicate `IS NOT NULL` in the right table, for example, `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `NOT LIKE`, or `NOT IN`. For example, create a materialized view as follows:

  ```SQL
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv4
  DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
  AS
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address
  FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
  ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
  ```

  `join_mv4` can rewrite the following query, where `customer.c_address = "Sb4gxKs7"` is the filtering predicate `IS NOT NULL`:

  ```SQL
  SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_custkey, c_address
  FROM lineorder LEFT OUTER JOIN customer
  ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
  WHERE customer.c_address = "Sb4gxKs7";
  ```

  Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

  ![Rewrite-8](../assets/Rewrite-8.png)

## Aggregation rewrite

StarRocks' asynchronous materialized view supports rewriting multi-table aggregate queries with all available aggregate functions, including bitmap_union, hll_union, and percentile_union. For example, create a materialized view as follows:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agg_mv1
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  lo_linenumber, 
  c_name, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
GROUP BY lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, c_name;
```

It can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  lo_linenumber, 
  c_name, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
GROUP BY lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, c_name;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

![Rewrite-9](../assets/Rewrite-9.png)

The following sections expound on the scenarios where the Aggregation Rewrite feature can be useful.

### Aggregation Rollup rewrite

StarRocks supports rewriting queries with Aggregation Rollup, that is, StarRocks can rewrite aggregate queries with a `GROUP BY a` clause using an asynchronous materialized view created with a `GROUP BY a,b` clause. For example, the following query can be rewritten using `agg_mv1`:

```SQL
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  c_name, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
GROUP BY lo_orderkey, c_name;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

> Currently, rewriting the grouping set, grouping set with rollup, or grouping set with cube is not supported.

Only certain aggregate functions support query rewrite with Aggregate Rollup. In the preceding example, if the materialized view `order_agg_mv` uses `count(distinct client_id)` instead of `bitmap_union(to_bitmap(client_id))`, StarRocks cannot rewrite the queries with Aggregate Rollup.

The following table shows the correspondence between the aggregate functions in the original query and the aggregate function used to build the materialized view. You can select the corresponding aggregate functions to build a materialized view according to your business scenario.

| **Aggregate function suppprted in original queries**   | **Function supported Aggregate Rollup in materialized view** |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sum                                                    | sum                                                          |
| count                                                  | count                                                        |
| min                                                    | min                                                          |
| max                                                    | max                                                          |
| avg                                                    | sum / count                                                  |
| bitmap_union, bitmap_union_count, count(distinct)      | bitmap_union                                                 |
| hll_raw_agg, hll_union_agg, ndv, approx_count_distinct | hll_union                                                    |
| percentile_approx, percentile_union                    | percentile_union                                             |

DISTINCT aggregates without the corresponding GROUP BY column cannot be rewritten with Aggregate Rollup. However, from StarRocks v3.1 onwards, if a query with an Aggregate Rollup DISTINCT aggregate function does not have a GROUP BY column but an equal predicate, it can also be rewritten by the relevant materialized view because StarRocks can convert the equal predicates into a GROUP BY constant expression.

In the following example, StarRocks can rewrite the query with the materialized view `order_agg_mv1`.

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW order_agg_mv1
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`order_id`) BUCKETS 12
REFRESH ASYNC START('2022-09-01 10:00:00') EVERY (interval 1 day)
AS
SELECT
    order_date,
    count(distinct client_id) 
FROM order_list 
GROUP BY order_date;


-- Query
SELECT
    order_date,
    count(distinct client_id) 
FROM order_list WHERE order_date='2023-07-03';
```

### COUNT DISTINCT rewrite

StarRocks supports rewriting COUNT DISTINCT calculations into bitmap-based calculations, enabling high-performance, precise deduplication using materialized views. For example, create a materialized view as follows:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW distinct_mv
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT lo_orderkey, bitmap_union(to_bitmap(lo_custkey)) AS distinct_customer
FROM lineorder
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

It can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
SELECT lo_orderkey, count(distinct lo_custkey) 
FROM lineorder 
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

## Nested materialized view rewrite

StarRocks supports rewriting queries using nested materialized view. For example, create the materialized views `join_mv2`, `agg_mv2`, and `agg_mv3` as follows:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv2
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_name, c_address
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;


CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agg_mv2
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  lo_linenumber, 
  c_name, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM join_mv2
GROUP BY lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, c_name;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agg_mv3
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(total_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(max_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM agg_mv2
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

Their relationship is as follows:

![Rewrite-11](../assets/Rewrite-11.png)

`agg_mv3` can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder INNER JOIN customer
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

![Rewrite-12](../assets/Rewrite-12.png)

## Union rewrite

### Predicate Union rewrite

When the predicate scope of a materialized view is a subset of the predicate scope of a query, the query can be rewritten using a UNION operation.

For example, create a materialized view as follows:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agg_mv4
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder
WHERE lo_orderkey < 300000000
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

It can rewrite the following query:

```SQL
select 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

![Rewrite-13](../assets/Rewrite-13.png)

In this context, `agg_mv5` contains data where `lo_orderkey < 300000000`. Data where `lo_orderkey >= 300000000` is directly obtained from the base table `lineorder`. Finally, these two sets of data are combined using a UNION operation and then aggregated to obtain the final result.

### Partition Union rewrite

Suppose you created a partitioned materialized view based on a partitioned table. When the partition range that a rewritable query scanned is a superset of the most recent partition range of the materialized view, the query will be rewritten using a UNION operation.

For example, consider the following materialized view `agg_mv4`. Its base table `lineorder` currently contains partitions from `p1` to `p7`, and the materialized view also contains partitions from `p1` to `p7`.

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agg_mv5
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
PARTITION BY RANGE(lo_orderdate)
REFRESH MANUAL
AS
SELECT 
  lo_orderdate, 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

If a new partition `p8`, with a partition range of `[("19990101"), ("20000101"))`,  is added to `lineorder`, the following query can be rewritten using a UNION operation:

```SQL
SELECT 
  lo_orderdate, 
  lo_orderkey, 
  sum(lo_revenue) AS total_revenue, 
  max(lo_discount) AS max_discount 
FROM lineorder
GROUP BY lo_orderkey;
```

Its original query plan and the one after the rewrite are as follows:

![Rewrite-14](../assets/Rewrite-14.png)

As shown above, `agg_mv5` contains the data from partitions `p1` to `p7`, and the data from partition `p8` is directly queried from `lineorder`. Finally, these two sets of data are combined using a UNION operation.

## View-based materialized view rewrite

StarRocks supports creating materialized views based on views. Subsequent queries against the views can be transparently rewritten.

For example, create the following views:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW customer_view1 
AS
SELECT c_custkey, c_name, c_address
FROM customer;

CREATE VIEW lineorder_view1
AS
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_custkey, lo_revenue
FROM lineorder;
```

Then, create the following materialized view based on the views:

```SQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW join_mv1
DISTRIBUTED BY hash(lo_orderkey)
AS
SELECT lo_orderkey, lo_linenumber, lo_revenue, c_name
FROM lineorder_view1 INNER JOIN customer_view1
ON lo_custkey = c_custkey;
```

During query rewrite, queries against `customer_view1` and `lineorder_view1` are automatically expanded to the base tables and then transparently matched and rewritten.

## External catalog-based materialized view rewrite

StarRocks supports building asynchronous materialized views on Hive catalogs, Hudi catalogs, and Iceberg catalogs, and transparently rewriting queries with them. External catalog-based materialized views support most of the query rewrite capabilities, but there are some limitations:

- Hudi, Iceberg, or JDBC catalog-based materialized views do not support Union rewrite.
- Hudi, Iceberg, or JDBC catalog-based materialized views do not support View Delta Join rewrite.
- Hudi, Iceberg, or JDBC catalog-based materialized views do not support the incremental refresh of partitions.

## Configure query rewrite

You can configure the asynchronous materialized view query rewrite through the following session variables:

| **Variable**                                | **Default** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enable_materialized_view_union_rewrite      | true        | Boolean value to control if to enable materialized view Union query rewrite. |
| enable_rule_based_materialized_view_rewrite | true        | Boolean value to control if to enable rule-based materialized view query rewrite. This variable is mainly used in single-table query rewrite. |
| nested_mv_rewrite_max_level                 | 3           | The maximum levels of nested materialized views that can be used for query rewrite. Type: INT. Range: [1, +∞). The value of `1` indicates that materialized views created on other materialized views will not be used for query rewrite. |

## Check if a query is rewritten

You can check if your query is rewritten by viewing its query plan using the EXPLAIN statement. If the field `TABLE` under the section `OlapScanNode` shows the name of the corresponding materialized view, it means that the query has been rewritten based on the materialized view.

```Plain
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT 
    order_id, sum(goods.price) AS total 
    FROM order_list INNER JOIN goods 
    ON goods.item_id1 = order_list.item_id2 
    GROUP BY order_id;

## Disable query rewrite

By default, StarRocks enables query rewrite for asynchronous materialized views created based on the default catalog. You can disable this feature by setting the session variable `enable_materialized_view_rewrite` to `false`.

For asynchronous materialized views created based on an external catalog, you can disable this feature by setting the materialized view property `force_external_table_query_rewrite` to `false` using [ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/ALTER_MATERIALIZED_VIEW.md).

## Limitations

In terms of materialized view-based query rewrite, StarRocks currently has the following limitations:

- StarRocks does not support rewriting queries with non-deterministic functions, including rand, random, uuid, and sleep.
- StarRocks does not support rewriting queries with window functions.
- Materialized views defined with statements containing LIMIT, ORDER BY, UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT, MINUS, GROUPING SETS, WITH CUBE, or WITH ROLLUP cannot be used for query rewrite.
- Strong consistency of query results is not guaranteed between base tables and materialized views built on external catalogs.
- Asynchronous materialized views created on base tables in a JDBC catalog do not support query rewrite.
