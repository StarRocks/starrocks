# Feature Support: Asynchronous Materialized Views

Asynchronous materialized views are supported from StarRocks v2.4 onwards. Asynchronous materialized views are designed to accelerate complex queries with joins or aggregations on large tables within StarRocks or in data lakes. The performance difference can be significant when a query is run frequently or is sufficiently complex. Additionally, asynchronous materialized views are especially useful for building mathematical models upon your data warehouse.

This document outlines the boundaries of competence for asynchronous materialized views and the supported version of the features involved.

**Different Join Methods**

- **Single Fact Table (v2.4+)**:  Establishing a partition mapping between the materialized view and the fact table ensures the automatic refresh of materialized view partitions when the fact table is updated.
- **Multiple Fact Tables (v3.3+)**: Establishing a partition mapping between the materialized view and multiple fact tables that are joined/unioned at the same time granularity ensures the automatic refresh of materialized view partitions when any of the fact tables are updated.
- **Temporal Dimension Table (v3.3+)**: Suppose the dimension table stores historical version data and is partitioned at a specific time granularity, and a fact table joins the dimension table at the same time granularity. Establishing a partition mapping between the materialized view and both the fact table and the dimension table ensures the automatic refresh of materialized view partitions when either table is updated.
