# How to contribute documentation

Thank you very much for contributing to StarRocks documentation! Your help is important to help improve the docs!

Before contributing, please read this article carefully to quickly understand the tips, writing process, and documentation templates.

## Tips

1. Language: Please use at least one language, Chinese or English. The bilingual version is highly preferred.
2. Index: When you add a topic, you also need to add an entry for the topic in the `sidebars.json` file of the `docs/docusaurus` folder. **The path to your topic must be a relative path from the `docs` folder.** This `sidebars.json` file will eventually be rendered as the side navigation bar for documentation on our official website. If you are not sure how to edit this file, you can leave this work to the documentation team.
3. Images: Images must first be put into the **assets** folder. When inserting images into the documentation, please use the relative path, such as `![test image](../../assets/test.png)`.
4. Links: For internal links (links to documentation on our official website), please use the relative path of the document, such as `[test md](./data_source/catalog/hive_catalog.md)`. For external links,  the format must be `[link text](link URL)`.
5. Code blocks: You must add a language identifier for code blocks, for example, `sql`.
6. Currently, special symbols are not  supported.

## Writing Process

1. **Writing phase**: Write the topic (in Markdown) according to the following template, and add the topic's index to the `sidebars.json` file if the topic is newly added.

    > - *Because the documentation is written in Markdown, we recommend that you use markdown-lint to check whether the documentation conforms to the Markdown syntax.*
    > - *When adding the topic index, please pay attention to* *its category* *in the `sidebars.json` file. For example, the ***Stream Load*** topic belongs to the **Loading** chapter.*

2. **Submission phase**: Create a pull request to submit the documentation changes to our documentation repository on GitHub, English documentation is in the `docs/en` folder of the [StarRocks repository](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks) and Chinese documentation is in the `docs/zh` folder.

   > **Note**
   >
   > All commits in your PR should be signed. To sign a commit you can add the `-s` argument. For example:
   >
   > `commit -s -m "Update the MV doc"`

3. Lists of settings

   Long lists of settings like this do not index well in search, and the reader will not find the information even when they type in the exact name of a setting:

   ```markdown
   - setting_name_foo

     Details for foo

   - setting_name_bar
     Details for bar
   ...
   ```

   Instead, use a section heading (e.g., `###`) for the setting name and remove the indent for the text:

   ```markdown
   ### setting_name_foo

   Details for foo

   ### setting_name_bar
   Details for bar
   ...
   ```

   |Search results with a long list:|Search results with H3 headings|

4. **Review phase**

    The review phase includes automatic checks and manual review.

    - Automatic checks: whether the submitter has signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and whether the documentation conforms to the Markdown syntax.
    - Manual review: Committers will read and communicate with you about the documentation. It will be merged into StarRocks documentation repository and updated on the official website.
