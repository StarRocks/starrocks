# Downgrade StarRocks

This topic describes how to downgrade your StarRocks cluster.

If an exception occurs after you upgrade a StarRocks cluster, you can downgrade it to the earlier version to quickly recover the cluster.

## Overview

Review the information in this section before downgrading. Perform any recommended actions.

### Downgrade paths

- **For patch version downgrade**

  You can downgrade your StarRocks cluster across patch versions, for example, from v2.2.11 directly to v2.2.6.

- **For minor version downgrade**

  For compatibility and safety reasons, we strongly recommend you downgrade your StarRocks cluster **consecutively from one minor version to another**. For example, to downgrade a StarRocks v2.5 cluster to v2.2, you need to downgrade it in the following order: v2.5.x --> v2.4.x --> v2.3.x --> v2.2.x.

- **For major version downgrade**

  You can only downgrade your StarRocks v3.0 cluster to v2.5.3 and later versions.

  - StarRocks upgrades the BDB library in v3.0. However, BDBJE cannot be rolled back. You must use BDB library of v3.0 after a downgrade.
  - The new RBAC privilege system is used by default after you upgrade to v3.0. You can only use the RBAC privilege system after a downgrade.

### Downgrade procedure

StarRocks' downgrade procedure is the reverse order of the [upgrade procedure](../deployment/upgrade.md#upgrade-procedure). Therefore, you need to **downgrade** **FEs** **first and then BEs and CNs**. Downgrading them in the wrong order may lead to incompatibility between FEs and BEs/CNs, and thereby cause the service to crash. For FE nodes, you must first downgrade all Follower FE nodes before downgrading the Leader FE node.

## Before you begin

During preparation, you must perform the compatibility configuration if you are up for a minor or major version downgrade. You also need to perform the downgrade availability test on one of the FEs or BEs before downgrading all nodes in the cluster.

### Perform compatibility configuration

If you want to downgrade your StarRocks cluster to an earlier minor or major version, you must perform the compatibility configuration. Compatibility configuration varies from the version of the StarRocks cluster you downgrade from.

#### From v2.2 and later versions

Set the FE configuration item `ignore_unknown_log_id` to `true`. Because it is a static parameter, you must modify it in the FE configuration file **fe.conf** and restart the node to allow the modification to take effect. After the downgrade and the first checkpoint are completed, you can reset it to `false` and restart the node.

#### From v2.4 and later versions

If you have enabled FQDN access, you must switch to IP address access before downgrading. See [Rollback FQDN](../administration/enable_fqdn.md#rollback) for detailed instructions.

### Perform downgrade availability test

Before downgrading all nodes in your cluster in production, you are strongly advised to perform a downgrade availability test on one of the BE and FE nodes to see if the downgrade affects your current data.

#### FE downgrade availability test

Follow these steps to perform the FE downgrade availability test:

1. In your development environment, deploy a test FE node of the version you want to downgrade to. See [Deploy StarRocks - Start the Leader FE node](../deployment/deploy_manually.md#step-1-start-the-leader-fe-node) for detailed instructions.
2. Modify the FE configuration file **fe.conf** of the test FE node:

   - Assign different `http_port`, `rpc_port`, `query_port`, and `edit_log_port` from those of the production cluster.
   - Add `cluster_id = 123456`.
   - Add `metadata_failure_recovery = true`.

3. Copy the **meta** directory of the Leader FE node of the production cluster and paste it into the deployment directory of the test FE node.
4. Modify **meta/image/VERSION** of the test FE node. Set `cluster_id` to `123456`.
5. Start the test FE node.

   ```Bash
   sh bin/start_fe.sh --daemon
   ```

6. Check if it is started successfully.

   ```Bash
   ps aux | grep StarRocksFE
   ```

   - If the test FE node starts successfully, it is safe to downgrade the FE nodes in the production environment.
   - If the test FE node fails to start, you must check the cause of the failure in the FE log file **fe.log** and solve the problem. If the problem is irresolvable, you can simply remove this FE node.

#### BE/CN downgrade availability test

> **CAUTION**
>
> The BE downgrade availability test causes the loss of a data replica. Make sure you have at least three complete data replicas before performing the test.

Follow these steps to perform the BE/CN downgrade availability test:

1. Choose a random BE/CN node, navigate to its working directory, and stop it.

   - BE node:

     ```Bash
     # Replace <be_dir> with the deployment directory of the BE node.
     cd <be_dir>/be
     ./bin/stop_be.sh
     ```

   - CN node:

     ```Bash
     # Replace <cn_dir> with the deployment directory of the CN node.
     cd <cn_dir>/be
     ./bin/stop_cn.sh
     ```

2. Replace the original deployment files under **bin** and **lib** with the ones of the earlier version.

   ```Bash
   mv lib lib.bak 
   mv bin bin.bak
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/lib  .
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/bin  .
   ```

3. Start the BE/CN node.

   - BE node:

     ```Bash
     sh bin/start_be.sh --daemon
     ```

   - CN node:

     ```Bash
     sh bin/start_cn.sh --daemon
     ```

4. Check if it is started successfully.

   ```Bash
   ps aux | grep starrocks_be
   ```

   - If the BE/CN node starts successfully, it is safe to downgrade the other BE/CN nodes.
   - If the BE/CN node fails to start, you must check the cause of the failure in the log files and solve the problem. If the problem is irresolvable, you can drop this BE/CN node, clean the data, restart the BE/CN node with deployment files of the earlier version, and add the BE/CN node back to the cluster.

## Downgrade FE

After the compatibility configuration and the availability test, you can downgrade the FE nodes. You must first downgrade the Follower FE nodes and then the Leader FE node.

1. Navigate to the working directory of the FE node and stop the node.

   ```Bash
   # Replace <fe_dir> with the deployment directory of the FE node.
   cd <fe_dir>/fe
   ./bin/stop_fe.sh
   ```

2. Replace the original deployment files under **bin**, **lib**, and **spark-dpp** with the ones of the earlier version.

   ```Bash
   mv lib lib.bak 
   mv bin bin.bak
   mv spark-dpp spark-dpp.bak
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/fe/lib  .   
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/fe/bin  .
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/fe/spark-dpp  .
   ```

   > **CAUTION**
   >
   > If you are downgrading StarRocks v3.0 to v2.5, you must follow these steps after you replace the deployment files:
   >
   > 1. Copy the file **fe/lib/starrocks-bdb-je-18.3.13.jar** of the v3.0 deployment to the directory **fe/lib** of the v2.5 deployment.
   > 2. Delete the file **fe/lib/je-7.\*.jar**.

3. Start the FE node.

   ```Bash
   sh bin/start_fe.sh --daemon
   ```

4. Check if the FE node is started successfully.

   ```Bash
   ps aux | grep StarRocksFE
   ```

5. Repeat the above procedures to downgrade other Follower FE nodes, and finally the Leader FE node.

   > **CAUTION**
   >
   > If you are downgrading StarRocks v3.0 to v2.5, you must follow these steps after the downgrade:
   >
   > 1. Run [ALTER SYSTEM CREATE IMAGE](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/ALTER%20SYSTEM.md) to create a new image.
   > 2. Wait for the new image to be synchronized to all Follower FEs.
   >
   > If you do not run this command, some of the downgrade operations may fail. ALTER SYSTEM CREATE IMAGE is supported from v2.5.3 and later.

## Downgrade BE

Having downgraded the FE nodes, you can then downgrade the BE nodes in the cluster.

1. Navigate to the working directory of the BE node and stop the node.

   ```Bash
   # Replace <be_dir> with the deployment directory of the BE node.
   cd <be_dir>/be
   ./bin/stop_be.sh
   ```

2. Replace the original deployment files under **bin** and **lib** with the ones of the earlier version.

   ```Bash
   mv lib lib.bak 
   mv bin bin.bak
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/lib  .
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/bin  .
   ```

3. Start the BE node.

   ```Bash
   sh bin/start_be.sh --daemon
   ```

4. Check if the BE node is started successfully.

   ```Bash
   ps aux | grep starrocks_be
   ```

5. Repeat the above procedures to downgrade other BE nodes.

## Downgrade CN

1. Navigate to the working directory of the CN node and stop the node gracefully.

   ```Bash
   # Replace <cn_dir> with the deployment directory of the CN node.
   cd <cn_dir>/be
   ./bin/stop_cn.sh --graceful
   ```

2. Replace the original deployment files under **bin** and **lib** with the ones of the earlier version.

   ```Bash
   mv lib lib.bak 
   mv bin bin.bak
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/lib  .
   cp -r /tmp/StarRocks-x.x.x/be/bin  .
   ```

3. Start the CN node.

   ```Bash
   sh bin/start_cn.sh --daemon
   ```

4. Check if the CN node is started successfully.

   ```Bash
   ps aux | grep  starrocks_be
   ```

5. Repeat the above procedures to downgrade other CN nodes.
