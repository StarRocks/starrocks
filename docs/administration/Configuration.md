# Parameter Configuration

This topic describes FE, BE, Broker, and system parameters. It also provides suggestions on how to configure and tune these parameters.

## FE configuration items

### FE static parameters

This section provides an overview of the static parameters that you can configure in the FE configuration file **fe.conf**. After you reconfigure these parameters for an FE, you must restart the FE to make the new parameter settings take effect.

## BE configuration items

Some BE configuration items are dynamic parameters which you can set them by commands when BE nodes are still online. The rest of them are static parameters. You can only set the static parameters of a BE node by changing them in the corresponding configuration file **be.conf**, and restart the BE node to allow the change to take effect.

### View BE configuration items

You can view the BE configuration items using the following command:

```shell
curl http://<BE_IP>:<BE_HTTP_PORT>/varz
```

### Configure BE dynamic parameters

You can configure a dynamic parameter of a BE node by using `curl` command.

```Shell
curl -XPOST http://be_host:http_port/api/update_config?<configuration_item>=<value>
```

## Configure broker

You can only set the configuration items of a broker by changing them in the corresponding configuration file **broker.conf**, and restart the broker to allow the change to take effect.

| Configuration item | Default | Unit | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hdfs_read_buffer_size_kb | 8192 | KB | Size of the buffer that is used to read data from HDFS. |
| hdfs_write_buffer_size_kb | 1024 | KB | Size of the buffer that is used to write data into HDFS. |
| client_expire_seconds | 300 | Second | Client sessions will be deleted if they do not receive any ping after the specified time. |
| broker_ipc_port | 8000 | N/A | The HDFS thrift RPC port. |
| sys_log_dir | ${BROKER_HOME}/log | N/A | The directory used to store system logs (including INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL). |
| sys_log_level | INFO | N/A | The log level. Valid values include INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL. |
| sys_log_roll_mode | SIZE-MB-1024 | N/A | The mode how system logs are segmented into log rolls. Valid values include TIME-DAY, TIME-HOUR, and SIZE-MB-nnn. The default value indicates that logs are segmented into rolls which are 1 GB each. |
| sys_log_roll_num | 30 | N/A | The number of log rolls to reserve. |
| audit_log_dir | ${BROKER_HOME}/log | N/A | The directory that stores audit log files. |
| audit_log_modules | Empty string | N/A | The modules for which StarRocks generates audit log entries. By default, StarRocks generates audit logs for the slow_query module and the query module. You can specify multiple modules, whose names must be separated by a comma (,) and a space. |
| audit_log_roll_mode | TIME-DAY | N/A | Valid values include `TIME-DAY`, `TIME-HOUR`, and `SIZE-MB-<size>`. |
| audit_log_roll_num | 10 | N/A | This configuration does not work if the audit_log_roll_mode is set to `SIZE-MB-<size>`. |
| sys_log_verbose_modules | com.starrocks | N/A | The modules for which StarRocks generates system logs. Valid values are namespaces in BE, including `starrocks`, `starrocks::vectorized`, and `pipeline`. |

## Set system configurations

### Linux Kernel

Linux kernel 3.10 or later is recommended.

### CPU configurations

| Configuration item | Description | Recommended value | How to set |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| scaling_governor | The parameter scaling_governor is used to control the CPU power mode. The default value is on-demand. The performance mode consumes more energy, produces better performance, and thereby is recommended in the deployment of StarRocks. | performance | echo 'performance' \| sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor |

### Memory configurations

| Configuration item | Description | Recommended value | How to set |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| overcommit_memory | Memory Overcommit allows the operating system to overcommit memory resource to processes. We recommend you enable Memory Overcommit. | 1 | echo 1 \| sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory |
| transparent_hugepage | Transparent Huge Pages is enabled by default. We recommend you disable this feature because it can interfere the memory allocator, and thereby lead to a drop in performance. | madvise | echo 'madvise' \| sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled |
| swappiness | We recommend you disable the swappiness to eliminate its affects on the performance. | 0 | echo 0 \| sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/swappiness |

### Storage configurations

We recommend you set different scheduler algorithms in accordance with the medium of your storage volumes.

| Configuration item | Description | Recommended value | How to set |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| scheduler | mq-deadline scheduler algorithm suits SATA disks. | mq-deadline | echo mq-deadline \| sudo tee /sys/block/vdb/queue/scheduler |
| scheduler | kyber scheduler algorithm suits NVME or SSD disks. | kyber | echo kyber \| sudo tee /sys/block/vdb/queue/scheduler |
| scheduler | If your system does not support kyber scheduler algorithm, we recommend you use none scheduler algorithm. | none | echo none \| sudo tee /sys/block/vdb/queue/scheduler |

### Network configurations

We recommend you use 10GB network in your StarRocks cluster. Otherwise, StarRocks will fail to achieve the expected performance. You can use iPerf to check the bandwidth of your cluster.

### File system configurations

We recommend you use the ext4 journaling file system. You can run the following command to check the mount type:

```Shell
df -Th
```

### High concurrency configurations

If your StarRocks cluster has a high load concurrency, we recommend you set the following configurations.

```Shell
echo 120000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
echo 60000 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count
echo 200000 > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
```

### User process configuration

You can set the maximum number of user processes by running the following command:

```Shell
ulimit -u 40960
```

### File descriptor configuration

Run the following command to the maximum number of file descriptors to `65535`.

```Shell
ulimit -n 65535
```

If this configuration becomes invalid after you re-connect to the cluster, you can set the `UsePAM` configuration item under **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** to `yes`, and restart the SSHD service.

### Others

| Configuration item | Recommended value | How to set |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| tcp abort on overflow | 1 | echo 1 \| sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_abort_on_overflow |
| somaxconn | 1024 | echo 1024 \| sudo tee /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn |
