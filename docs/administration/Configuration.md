# Parameter configuration

This topic describes FE, BE, and system parameters. It also provides suggestions on how to configure and tune these parameters.

## FE configuration items

FE parameters are classified into dynamic parameters and static parameters.

- Dynamic parameters can be configured and adjusted by running SQL commands, which is very convenient. But the configurations become invalid if you restart your FE. Therefore, we recommend that you also modify the configuration items in the `fe.conf` file to prevent the loss of modifications.

- Static parameters can only be configured and adjusted in the FE configuration file **fe.conf**. **After you modify this file, you must restart your FE for the changes to take effect.**

Whether a parameter is a dynamic parameter is indicated by the `IsMutable` column in the output of [ADMIN SHOW CONFIG](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/ADMIN%20SHOW%20CONFIG.md). `TRUE` indicates a dynamic parameter.

Note that both dynamic and static FE parameters can be configured in the **fe.conf** file.

### View FE configuration items

After your FE is started, you can run the ADMIN SHOW FRONTEND CONFIG command on your MySQL client to check the parameter configurations. If you want to query the configuration of a specific parameter, run the following command:

```SQL
 ADMIN SHOW FRONTEND CONFIG [LIKE "pattern"];
 ```

 For detailed description of the returned fields, see [ADMIN SHOW CONFIG](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/ADMIN%20SHOW%20CONFIG.md).

> **NOTE**
>
> You must have administrator's privilege to run cluster administration-related commands.

### Configure FE dynamic parameters

You can configure or modify the settings of FE dynamic parameters using [ADMIN SET FRONTEND CONFIG](../sql-reference/sql-statements/Administration/ADMIN%20SET%20CONFIG.md).

```SQL
ADMIN SET FRONTEND CONFIG ("key" = "value");
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The configurations will be restored to the default values in the `fe.conf` file after the FE restarts. Therefore, we recommend that you also modify the configuration items in `fe.conf` to prevent the loss of modifications.

This parameter is valid only for Broker Load. The value must be less than `max_running_txn_num_per_db`. From v2.5 onwards, the default value is changed from `10` to `2`. The alias is `async_load_task_pool_size`.|
| load_straggler_wait_second              | s    | 300                                             | The maximum loading lag that can be tolerated by a BE replica. If this value is exceeded, cloning is performed to clone data from other replicas. Unit: seconds. |

The number refers to all jobs, such as table creation, loading, and schema change jobs. If the number of pending jobs in an FE reaches this value, the FE will reject new load requests. This parameter takes effect only for asynchronous loading. From v2.5 onwards, the default value is changed from 100 to 1024.|
| max_load_timeout_second                 | s    | 259200                                          | The maximum timeout duration allowed for a load job. The load job fails if this limit is exceeded. This limit applies to all types of load jobs. Unit: seconds. |

The default value is 100. If this value is exceeded, incoming load jobs will not be executed. If the incoming load job is a synchronous load job, it will be rejected. If it is an asynchronous load job, it will be put into the waiting queue. We do not recommend you increase this value because this will increase system load. |
| load_parallel_instance_num              | -    | 1                                               | The maximum number of concurrent loading instances for each load job on a BE. |

The default value is 3 days. After this duration expires, the labels will be deleted. This parameter applies to all types of load jobs. Unit: seconds. A value too large consumes a lot of memory. |
| max_routine_load_job_num                | -    | 100                                             | The maximum number of Routine Load jobs in a StarRocks cluster. |

#### Storage

| Parameter                                     | Unit | Default                | Description                                                  |

| enable_strict_storage_medium_check            | -    | FALSE                  | Whether the FE strictly checks the storage medium of BEs when users create tables. If this parameter is set to `TRUE`, the FE checks the storage medium of BEs when users create tables and returns an error if the storage medium of the BE is different from the `storage_medium` parameter specified in the CREATE TABLE statement. For example, the storage medium specified in the CREATE TABLE statement is SSD but the actual storage medium of BEs is HDD. As a result, the table creation fails. If this parameter is `FALSE`, the FE does not check the storage medium of BEs when users create table. |
| enable_auto_tablet_distribution               | -    | TRUE                   | Whether to automatically set the number of buckets. <ul><li> If this parameter is set to `TRUE`, you don't need to specify the number of buckets when you create a table or add a partition. StarRocks automatically determines the number of buckets. For the strategy of automatically setting the number of buckets, see [Determine the number of buckets](../table_design/Data_distribution.md#determine-the-number-of-buckets).</li><li>If this parameter is set to `FALSE`, you need to manually specify the the number of buckets when you create a table or add a partition. If you do not specify the bucket count when adding a new partition to a table, the new partition inherits the bucket count set at the creation of the table. However, you can also manually specify the number of buckets for the new partition.</li></ul>Starting from version 2.5.7, StarRocks supports setting this parameter.|
| storage_usage_soft_limit_percent              | %    | 90                     | If the storage usage (in percentage) of the BE storage directory exceeds this value and the remaining storage space is less than `storage_usage_soft_limit_reserve_bytes`, tablets cannot be cloned into this directory. |
| storage_usage_soft_limit_reserve_bytes        | Byte | 200 \* 1024 \* 1024 \* 1024 | If the remaining storage space in the BE storage directory is less than this value and the storage usage (in percentage) exceeds `storage_usage_soft_limit_percent`, tablets cannot be cloned into this directory. |

| recover_with_empty_tablet                     | -    | FALSE                  | Whether to replace a lost or corrupted tablet replica with an empty one. If a tablet replica is lost or corrupted, data queries on this tablet or other healthy tablets may fail. Replacing the lost or corrupted tablet replica with an empty tablet ensures that the query can still be executed. However, the result may be incorrect because data is lost. The default value is `FALSE`, which means lost or corrupted tablet replicas are not replaced with empty ones and the query fails. |
| tablet_create_timeout_second                  | s    | 10                      | The timeout duration for creating a tablet, in seconds.       |

This parameter takes effect only when `tablet_sched_balancer_strategy` is set to `disk_and_tablet`. If the disk usage of all BEs is lower than 50%, disk usage is considered balanced. For the `disk_and_tablet` policy, if the difference between the highest and lowest BE disk usage is greater than 10%, disk usage is considered unbalanced and tablet re-balancing is triggered. The alias is `balance_load_disk_safe_threshold`. |
| tablet_sched_balance_load_score_threshold     | -    | 0.1                    | The threshold for determining whether the BE load is balanced. This parameter takes effect only when `tablet_sched_balancer_strategy` is set to `be_load_score`. A BE whose load is 10% lower than the average load is in low load state, and a BE whose load is 10% higher than the average load is in high load state. The alias is `balance_load_score_threshold`. |

## BE configuration items

Some BE configuration items are dynamic parameters which you can set them by commands when BE nodes are still online. The rest of them are static parameters. You can only set the static parameters of a BE node by changing them in the corresponding configuration file **be.conf**, and restart the BE node to allow the change to take effect.

### View BE configuration items

You can view the BE configuration items using the following command:

```shell
curl http://<BE_IP>:<BE_HTTP_PORT>/varz
```

### Configure BE dynamic parameters

You can configure a dynamic parameter of a BE node by using the `curl` command.

```Shell
curl -XPOST http://be_host:http_port/api/update_config?<configuration_item>=<value>
