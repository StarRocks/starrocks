# Deploy Broker

This topic describes how to deploy Broker. With Broker, StarRocks can read data from source such as HDFS and S3, and pre-process, load, and backup the data with its own computing resources.

## Download and decompress the installer

[Download](https://www.starrocks.io/download/community) and decompress StarRocks installer.

```bash
tar -xzvf StarRocks-x.x.x.tar.gz
```

> **CAUTION**
>
> Replace the file name in the command as the real file name you downloaded.

## Configure a Broker

Navigate to **StarRocks-x.x.x/apache_hdfs_broker**.

```bash
cd StarRocks-x.x.x/apache_hdfs_broker
```

> **CAUTION**
>
> Replace the file name in the command as the real file name you downloaded.
Specify the Broker configuration file **conf/apache_hdfs_broker.conf**. Because the default configuration can be used directly, no configuration item is changed in the following example. You can copy your own HDFS cluster configuration file and paste it under **conf** directory.

## Start a Broker

Run the following command to start Broker.

```bash
./apache_hdfs_broker/bin/start_broker.sh --daemon
```

## Add a Broker to cluster

Run the following command to add the Broker to cluster.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ADD BROKER broker_name "broker_ip:broker_port";
```

> **NOTE**
>
> - By default, the port for Broker is `8000`.
> - When multiple Brokers are added to a cluster at the same time, they share the same `broker_name`.

## verify if Broker starts

You can verify if the BE node is started properly via MySQL client.

```sql
SHOW PROC "/brokers"\G
```

Example:

```plain text
MySQL [(none)]> SHOW PROC "/brokers"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
          Name: broker1
            IP: x.x.x.x
          Port: 8000
         Alive: true
 LastStartTime: 2022-05-19 11:21:36
LastUpdateTime: 2022-05-19 11:28:31
        ErrMsg:
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

When the field `Alive` is `true`, the Broker is properly started and added to the cluster.

## Stop a Broker

Run the following command to stop a Broker.

```bash
./bin/stop_broker.sh --daemon
```

## Configure broker

You can only set the configuration items of a broker by changing them in the corresponding configuration file **broker.conf**, and restart the broker to allow the change to take effect.

| Configuration item | Default | Unit | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hdfs_read_buffer_size_kb | 8192 | KB | Size of the buffer that is used to read data from HDFS. |
| hdfs_write_buffer_size_kb | 1024 | KB | Size of the buffer that is used to write data into HDFS. |
| client_expire_seconds | 300 | Second | Client sessions will be deleted if they do not receive any ping after the specified time. |
| broker_ipc_port | 8000 | N/A | The HDFS thrift RPC port. |
| sys_log_dir | ${BROKER_HOME}/log | N/A | The directory used to store system logs (including INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL). |
| sys_log_level | INFO | N/A | The log level. Valid values include INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL. |
| sys_log_roll_mode | SIZE-MB-1024 | N/A | The mode how system logs are segmented into log rolls. Valid values include TIME-DAY, TIME-HOUR, and SIZE-MB-nnn. The default value indicates that logs are segmented into rolls which are 1 GB each. |
| sys_log_roll_num | 30 | N/A | The number of log rolls to reserve. |
| audit_log_dir | ${BROKER_HOME}/log | N/A | The directory that stores audit log files. |
| audit_log_modules | Empty string | N/A | The modules for which StarRocks generates audit log entries. By default, StarRocks generates audit logs for the slow_query module and the query module. You can specify multiple modules, whose names must be separated by a comma (,) and a space. |
| audit_log_roll_mode | TIME-DAY | N/A | Valid values include `TIME-DAY`, `TIME-HOUR`, and `SIZE-MB-<size>`. |
| audit_log_roll_num | 10 | N/A | This configuration does not work if the audit_log_roll_mode is set to `SIZE-MB-<size>`. |
| sys_log_verbose_modules | com.starrocks | N/A | The modules for which StarRocks generates system logs. Valid values are namespaces in BE, including `starrocks`, `starrocks::vectorized`, and `pipeline`. |
