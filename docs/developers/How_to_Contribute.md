## Contribution process

If you don't know how to get started, this is the process we suggest for contributions. This process is designed to help reduce your learning curve and get your pull requests merged more efficiently!

1. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/StarRocks/starrocks).

2. Start a discussion by creating a Github [issue](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/issues), or asking on [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/starrocks/shared_invite/zt-1d0cs3cs2-7eL5Q0cGoBofhyIOx7pLfQ)(unless the change is trivial).

   Before getting your hands on codes, you should comment in the issue body, and inform the maintainer to assign you the issue that you wish to solve. It is recommended to share your plan on how to solve this problem in the issue body as well.

   - This step helps you identify possible collaborators and reviewers.
   - Will the change conflict with another change in progress? If so, work with others to minimize impact.
   - Is this change major? If so, work with others to break the change into smaller steps.

3. Implement the change.

   - If the change is major, split it into smaller PRs.

   - Include tests and documentation as necessary.

4. Create a Github [pull request](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/pulls):

   In StarRocks community, we follow the fork-and-merge GitHub workflow when contributing code.

   - Create a fork of StarRocks in your GitHub account.
   - Clone this forked repository to your computer.
   - Check out a new branch based on the branch you expect to contribute to.
   - Commit your code changes to the new branch.
   - Push the branch with code changes to GitHub.
   - Create a PR to submit your code changes. It is recommended to submit ONE commit in ONE PR. You can follow the [PR templated](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when submitting a PR.
   - Make sure the pull request passes the tests in CI.

5. Review is required by at least 2 reviewers:

   - For StarRocks project, we require at least 2 lgtm from reviewers (committers) to merge the pull request.

   - This normally happens within a few days, but may take longer if the change is major, complex, or if a critical reviewer is unavailable. (feel free to ping the reviewer on the pull request).

6. Maintainers merge the pull request after the final changes are accepted.
