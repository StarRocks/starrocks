# Strict mode

Strict mode is an optional property that you can configure for data loads. It affects the loading behavior and the final loaded data.

This topic introduces what strict mode is and how to set strict mode.

## Understand strict mode

If the original data type of a source column, or the new data type of a source column upon function computation, differs from the data type of the matching destination column, StarRocks converts the source column values to the destination data type during loading. Source column values that fail to be converted are processed into `NULL` values, which are called "error data." Rows that contain such error data are called "error rows."

Strict mode works as follows:

- If strict mode is enabled, StarRocks loads only qualified rows. It filters out error rows and returns details about the error rows.
- If strict mode is disabled, StarRocks loads qualified rows together with error rows.

For example, you want to load four rows that hold `\N` (`\N` denotes a `NULL` value), `abc`, `2000`, and `1` values respectively in a column from a CSV-formatted data file into a StarRocks table, and the data type of the destination StarRocks table column is TINYINT [-128, 127].

- The source column value `\N` is processed into `NULL` upon conversion to TINYINT.

  - > **NOTE**
    >
    > `\N` is always processed into `NULL` upon conversion regardless of the destination data type.

- The source column value `abc` is processed into `NULL`, because its data type is not TINYINT and the conversion fails.

- The source column value `2000` is processed into `NULL`, because it is beyond the range supported by TINYINT and the conversion fails.

- The source column value `1` can be properly converted to a TINYINT-type value `1`.

If strict mode is disabled, StarRocks loads all the four rows.

If strict mode is enabled, StarRocks loads only the rows that hold `\N` or `1` and filters out the rows that hold `abc` or `2000`. The rows filtered out are counted against the maximum percentage of rows that can be filtered out due to inadequate data quality as specified by the `max_filter_ratio` parameter.

### Final loaded data with strict mode disabled

| Source column value | Column value upon conversion to TINYINT | Load result when destination column allows NULL values | Load result when destination column does not allow NULL values |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \N                 | NULL                                    | The value `NULL` is loaded.                            | An error is reported.                                        |
| abc                 | NULL                                    | The value `NULL` is loaded.                            | An error is reported.                                        |
| 2000                | NULL                                    | The value `NULL` is loaded.                            | An error is reported.                                        |
| 1                   | 1                                       | The value `1` is loaded.                               | The value `1` is loaded.                                     |

### Final loaded data with strict mode enabled

## Set strict mode

If you run a [Stream Load](../../loading/StreamLoad.md), [Broker Load](../../loading/BrokerLoad.md), [Routine Load](../../loading/RoutineLoad.md), or [Spark Load](../../loading/SparkLoad.md) job to load data, use the `strict_mode` parameter to set strict mode for the load job. Valid values are `true` and `false`. The default value is `false`. The value `true` enables strict mode, and the value `false` disables strict mode.

If you execute [INSERT](../../loading/InsertInto.md) to load data, use the `enable_insert_strict` session variable to set strict mode. Valid values are `true` and `false`. The default value is `true`. The value `true` enables strict mode, and the value `false` disables strict mode.

Examples are as follows:

### Stream Load

```Bash
curl --location-trusted -u <username>:<password> \
    -H "strict_mode: {true | false}" \
    -T <file_name> -XPUT \
    http://<fe_host>:<fe_http_port>/api/<database_name>/<table_name>/_stream_load
```

### Broker Load

```SQL
LOAD LABEL [<database_name>.]<label_name>
