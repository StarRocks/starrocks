## Description

Creates a new table in StarRocks.

## Syntax

```Plain%20Text
CREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [database.]table_name
(column_definition1[, column_definition2, ...]
[, index_definition1[, index_definition12,]])
[ENGINE = [olap|mysql|elasticsearch|hive|hudi|iceberg|jdbc]]

[COMMENT "table comment"]
[partition_desc]
distribution_desc
[rollup_index]
[PROPERTIES ("key"="value", ...)]
[BROKER PROPERTIES ("key"="value", ...)]
```

## Parameters

### column_definition

Syntax:

```SQL
col_name col_type [agg_type] [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT "default_value"]
```

**col_name**：Column name.

**col_type**：Column type. Specific column information, such as types and ranges:

- TINYINT（1 byte): Ranges from -2^7 + 1 to 2^7 - 1.
- SMALLINT (2 bytes): Ranges from -2^15 + 1 to 2^15 - 1.
- INT（4 bytes): Ranges from -2^31 + 1 to 2^31 - 1.
- BIGINT（8 bytes): Ranges from -2^63 + 1 to 2^63 - 1.
- LARGEINT（16 bytes): Ranges from -2^127 + 1 to 2^127 - 1.
- FLOAT（4 bytes): Supports scientific notation.
- DOUBLE（8 bytes): Supports scientific notation.
- DECIMAL[(precision, scale)] (16 bytes)

  - Default value: DECIMAL(10, 0)
  - precision: 1 ~ 38
  - scale: 0 ~ precision
  - Integer part：precision - scale

    Scientific notation is not supported.

- DATE (3 bytes): Ranges from 0000-01-01 to 9999-12-31.
- DATETIME (8 bytes): Ranges from 0000-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.
- CHAR[(length)]: Fixed length string. Range：1 ~ 255. Default value: 1.
- VARCHAR[(length)]: A variable-length string. The default value is 1. Unit: bytes. In versions earlier than StarRocks 2.1, the value range of `length` is 1–65533. [Preview] In StarRocks 2.1 and later versions, the value range of `length` is 1–1048576.
- HLL (1~16385 bytes): For HLL type, there's no need to specify length or default value. The length will be controlled within the system according to data aggregation. HLL column can only be queried or used by [hll_union_agg](../../sql-functions/aggregate-functions/hll_union_agg.md), [Hll_cardinality](../../sql-functions/scalar-functions/hll_cardinality.md), and [hll_hash](../../sql-functions/aggregate-functions/hll_hash.md).
- BITMAP: Bitmap type does not require specified length or default value. It represents a set of unsigned bigint numbers. The largest element could be up to 2^64 - 1.

**agg_type**：aggregation type. If not specified, this column is key column.
If specified, it is value column. The aggregation types supported are as follows:

- SUM, MAX, MIN, REPLACE
- HLL_UNION (only for HLL type)
- BITMAP_UNION(only for BITMAP)
- REPLACE_IF_NOT_NULL：This means the imported data will only be replaced when it is of non-null value. If it is of null value, StarRocks will retain the original value.

> NOTE
>
> - When the column of aggregation type BITMAP_UNION is imported, its original data types must be TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, and BIGINT.
> - If NOT NULL is specified by REPLACE_IF_NOT_NULL column when the table was created, StarRocks will still convert the data to NULL without sending an error report to the user. With this, the user can import selected columns.

This aggregation type applies ONLY to the aggregation model whose key_desc type is AGGREGATE KEY.

**NULL | NOT NULL**: Whether the column is allowed to be `NULL`. By default, `NULL` is specified for all columns in a table that uses the Duplicate Key, Aggregate Key, or Unique Key model. In a table that uses the Primary Key model, by default, value columns are specified with `NULL`, whereas key columns are specified with `NOT NULL`. If `NULL` values are included in the raw data, present them with `\N`. StarRocks treats `\N` as `NULL` during data loading.

**DEFAULT "default_value"**: the default value of a column. When you load data into StarRocks, if the source field mapped onto the column is empty, StarRocks automatically fills the default value in the column. You can specify a default value in one of the following ways:

- **DEFAULT current_timestamp**: Use the current time as the default value. For more information, see [current_timestamp()](../../sql-functions/date-time-functions/current_timestamp.md).
- **DEFAULT <default_value>**: Use a given value of the column data type as the default value. For example, if the data type of the column is VARCHAR, you can specify a VARCHAR string, such as beijing, as the default value, as presented in `DEFAULT "beijing"`. Note that default values cannot be any of the following types: ARRAY, BITMAP, JSON, HLL, and BOOLEAN.
- **DEFAULT (\<expr\>)**: Use the result returned by a given function as the default value. Only the [uuid()](../../sql-functions/utility-functions/uuid.md) and [uuid_numeric()](../../sql-functions/utility-functions/uuid_numeric.md) expressions are supported.

### index_definition

You can only create bitmap indexes when you create tables. For more information about parameter descriptions and usage notes, see [Bitmap indexing](../../../using_starrocks/Bitmap_index.md#create-a-bitmap-index).

```SQL
INDEX index_name (col_name[, col_name, ...]) [USING BITMAP] COMMENT 'xxxxxx'
```

### ENGINE type

Default value: olap. If this parameter is not specified, an OLAP table (StarRocks native table) is created by default.

Optional value: mysql, elasticsearch, hive, jdbc (2.3 and later), iceberg, and hudi (2.2 and later). If you want to create an external table to query external data sources, specify `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` and set `ENGINE` to any of these values. You can refer to [External table](../../../data_source/External_table.md) for more information.

- For MySQL, specify the following properties:

    ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (
        "host" = "mysql_server_host",
        "port" = "mysql_server_port",
        "user" = "your_user_name",
        "password" = "your_password",
        "database" = "database_name",
        "table" = "table_name"
    )
    ```

    Note:

    "table_name" in MySQL should indicate the real table name. In contrast, "table_name" in CREATE TABLE statement indicates the name of this mysql table on StarRocks. They can either be different or the same.

    The aim of creating MySQL tables in StarRocks is to access MySQL database. StarRocks itself does not maintain or store any MySQL data.

- For Elasticsearch, specify the following properties:

    ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (

    "hosts" = "http://192.168.0.1:8200,http://192.168.0.2:8200",
    "user" = "root",
    "password" = "root",
    "index" = "tindex",
    "type" = "doc"
    )
    ```

  - `hosts`: the URL that is used to connect your Elasticsearch cluster. You can specify one or more URLs.
  - `user`: the account of the root user that is used to log in to your Elasticsearch cluster for which basic authentication is enabled.
  - `password`: the password of the preceding root account.
  - `index`: the index of the StarRocks table in your Elasticsearch cluster. The index name is the same as the StarRocks table name. You can set this parameter to the alias of the StarRocks table.
  - `type`: the type of index. The default value is `doc`.

- For Hive, specify the following properties:

    ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (

        "database" = "hive_db_name",
        "table" = "hive_table_name",
        "hive.metastore.uris" = "thrift://127.0.0.1:9083"
    )
    ```

    Here, database is the name of the corresponding database in Hive table. Table is the name of Hive table. hive.metastore.uris is the server address.

- For JDBC, specify the following properties:

    ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (
    "resource"="jdbc0",
    "table"="dest_tbl"
    )
    ```

    `resource` is the JDBC resource name and `table` is the destination table.

- For Iceberg, specify the following properties:

   ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (
    "resource" = "iceberg0", 
    "database" = "iceberg", 
    "table" = "iceberg_table"
    )
    ```

    `resource` is the Iceberg resource name. `database` is the Iceberg database. `table` is the Iceberg table.

- For Hudi, specify the following properties:

  ```Plain%20Text
    PROPERTIES (
    "resource" = "hudi0", 
    "database" = "hudi", 
    "table" = "hudi_table" 
    )
    ```

### key_desc

Syntax：

```SQL
key_type(k1[,k2 ...])
```

Data is sequenced in specified key columns and has different attributes for different key types:

- AGGREGATE KEY: Identical content in key columns will be aggregated into value columns according to the specified aggregation type. It usually applies to business scenarios such as financial statements and multi-dimensional analysis.
- UNIQUE KEY/PRIMARY KEY: Identical content in key columns will be replaced in value columns according to the import sequence. It can be applied to make addition, deletion, modification and query on key columns.
- DUPLICATE KEY: Identical content in key columns, which also exists in StarRocks at the same time. It can be used to store detailed data or data with no aggregation attributes. **DUPLICATE KEY is the default type. Data will be sequenced according to key columns.**

> **NOTE**
>
> Value columns do not need to specify aggregation types when other key_type is used to create tables with the exception of AGGREGATE KEY.

### partition_desc

Partition description can be used in the following three ways:

#### LESS THAN

Syntax:

```Plain%20Text
PARTITION BY RANGE (k1, k2, ...)
(
    PARTITION partition_name1 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE|("value1", "value2", ...),
    PARTITION partition_name2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE|("value1", "value2", ...)
    ...
)
```

Note:

Please use specified key columns and specified value ranges for partitioning.

- Partition name only supports [A-z0-9_]
- Columns in Range partition only support the following types: TINYINT, SAMLLINT, INT, BIGINT, LARGEINT, DATE, and DATETIME.
- Partitions are left closed and right open. The left boundary of the first partition is of minimum value.
- NULL value is stored only in partitions that contain minimum values. When the partition containing the minimum value is deleted, NULL values can no longer be imported.
- Partition columns can either be single columns or multiple columns. The partition values are the default minimum values.

Please note:

- Partitions are often used for managing data related to time.
- When data backtracking is needed, you may want to consider emptying the first partition for adding partitions later when necessary.

#### Fixed Range

Syntax:

```SQL
PARTITION BY RANGE (k1, k2, k3, ...)
(
    PARTITION partition_name1 VALUES [("k1-lower1", "k2-lower1", "k3-lower1",...), ("k1-upper1", "k2-upper1", "k3-upper1", ...)),
    PARTITION partition_name2 VALUES [("k1-lower1-2", "k2-lower1-2", ...), ("k1-upper1-2", MAXVALUE, )),
    "k3-upper1-2", ...
)
```

Note:

- Fixed Range is more flexible than LESS THAN. You can customize the left and right partitions.
- Fixed Range is the same as LESS THAN in the other aspects.

#### Create partitions in bulk

Syntax

```Plain%20Text
PARTITION BY RANGE (datekey) (

    START ("2021-01-01") END ("2021-01-04") EVERY (INTERVAL 1 day)

)
```

Description

You can specify the value for `START` and `END` and the expression in `EVERY` to create partitions in bulk .

- If `datekey` supports DATE and INTEGER data type, the data type of `START`, `END`, and `EVERY` must be the same as the data type of `datekey`.
- If `datekey` only supports DATE data type, you need to use the `INTERVAL` keyword to specify the date interval. You can specify the date interval by day, week, month, or year. The naming conventions of partitions are the same as those for dynamic partitions.

For more information, see [Data distribution](../../../table_design/Data_distribution.md#create-and-modify-partitions-in-bulk).

### distribution_des

Syntax:

```SQL
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (k1[,k2 ...]) [BUCKETS num]
```

Data in partitions can be subdivided into tablets based on the hash values of the bucketing columns and the number of buckets. We recommend that you choose the column that satisfy the following two requirements as the bucketing column.

- high cardinality column such as ID
- column that often used as a filter in queries

But if the column that satisfies both requirements does not exist, you need to determine the buckting column according to the complexity of queries.

- If the query is complex, it is recommended that you select the high cardinality column as the bucketing column to ensure that the data is as balanced as possible in each bucket and improve the cluster resource utilization.
- If the query is relatively simple, then it is recommended to select the column that is often used as in the query condition as the bucketing column to improve the query efficiency.

If partition data cannot be evenly distributed into each tablet by using one bucketing column, you can choose multiple bucketing columns but three bucketing columns at most. For more information about , pleaese see [choose bucketing columns](../../../table_design/Data_distribution.md).

**Precautions**:

- **When a table is created, you must specify the bucketing columns**.
- The values of bucketing columns cannot be updated.
- Bucketing columns cannot be modified after they are specified.
- Since StarRocks 2.5, you do not need to set the number of buckets when you create a table, and StarRocks sets the number of buckets automatically. If you want to set the number of buckets, see [determine the number of tablets](../../../table_design/Data_distribution.md#determine-the-number-of-tablets).

### PROPERTIES

#### Specify storage medium, storage cooldown time, replica number

- If ENGINE type is olap. Users can specify storage medium, cooldown time, and replica number.

```Plain%20Text
PROPERTIES (
    "storage_medium" = "[SSD|HDD]",
    [ "storage_cooldown_time" = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", ]
    [ "replication_num" = "3" ]
)
```

storage_medium: SSD or HDD can be specified as the initial storage medium.

> **Note**
>
> When the FE configuration item `enable_strict_storage_medium_check` is `True` and the storage medium is not specified, the statement for creating a table will report an error: Failed to find enough host in all backends with storage medium is SSD|HDD.

storage_cooldown_time: the storage cooldown time for a partition. If the storage medium is SSD, SSD is switched to HDD after the time specified by this parameter. Format: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss". The specified time must be later than the current time. If this parameter is not explicitly specified, auto-cooldown is not performed by default.

replication_num: number of replicas in the specified partition. Default number: 3.

When the table has only one partition, the properties belongs to the table. When the table has two levels of partitions, the properties belong to each partition. Users can also specify different properties for different partitions through ADD ADDITION and MODIFY PARTITION statements.

#### Add bloomfilter index for a column

If Engine type is olap, users can specify a column to adopt bloom filter index which applies only to the condition where in and equal are query filters. More discrete values in this column will result in more precise queries. Bloom filter currently supports the key column, with the exception of the key column in TINYINT FLOAT DOUBLE type, and the value column with the aggregation method REPLACE.

```SQL
PROPERTIES (
    "bloom_filter_columns"="k1,k2,k3"
)
```

#### Use Colocate Join

If you want to use Colocate Join attributes, specify it in `properties`.

```SQL
PROPERTIES (
    "colocate_with"="table1"
)
```

#### Configure dynamic partitions

If you want to use dynamic partition attributes, please specify it in properties.

```SQL
PROPERTIES (

    "dynamic_partition.enable" = "true|false",
    "dynamic_partition.time_unit" = "DAY|WEEK|MONTH",
    "dynamic_partition.start" = "${integer_value}",
    "dynamic_partition.end" = "${integer_value}",
    "dynamic_partition.prefix" = "${string_value}",
    "dynamic_partition.buckets" = "${integer_value}"
```

**`PROPERTIES`**

| parameter                   | required | description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dynamic_partition.enable    | No       | enables dynamic partitioning. Valid values are `TRUE` and `FALSE`. The default value is `TRUE`. |
| dynamic_partition.time_unit | Yes      | the time granularity for dynamically created  partitions. It is a required parameter. Valid values are `DAY`, `WEEK`, and `MONTH`.The time granularity determines the suffix format for dynamically created partitions.<br/>  - If the value is `DAY`,  the suffix format for dynamically created partitions is yyyyMMdd. An example partition name suffix is `20200321`.<br/>  - If the value is `WEEK`, the suffix format for dynamically created partitions is yyyy_ww, for example `2020_13` for the 13th week of 2020.<br/>  - If the value is `MONTH`, the suffix format for dynamically created partitions is yyyyMM, for example `202003`. |
| dynamic_partition.start     | No       | the starting offset of dynamic partitioning. The value of this parameter must be a negative integer. The partitions before this offset will be deleted based on the current day, week, or month which is determined by the value of the parameter `dynamic_partition.time_unit`. The default value is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, namely, -2147483648, which means that the history partitions will not be deleted. |
| dynamic_partition.end       | Yes      | the end offset of dynamic partitioning. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer. The partitions from the current day, week, or month to the end offset will be created in advance. |
| dynamic_partition.prefix    | No       | the prefix added to the names of dynamic partitions. The default value is `p`. |
| dynamic_partition.buckets   | No       | the number of buckets per dynamic partition. The default value is the same as the number of buckets determined by the reserved word BUCKETS or automatically set by StarRocks. |

#### Set data compression algorithm

You can specify a data compression algorithm for a table by adding property `compression` when you create a table.

The valid values of `compression` are:

- `LZ4`: the LZ4 algorithm.
- `ZSTD`: the Zstandard algorithm.
- `ZLIB`: the zlib algorithm.
- `SNAPPY`: the Snappy algorithm.

For more information about how to choose a suitable data compression algorithm, see [Data compression](../../../table_design/data_compression.md).

#### Set write quorum for data loading

If your StarRocks cluster has multiple data replicas, you can set different write quorum for tables, that is, how many replicas are required to return loading success before StarRocks can determine the loading task is successful. You can specify write quorum by adding the property `write_quorum` when you create a table.

The valid values of `write_quorum` are:

- `MAJORITY`：Default value. When the **majority** of data replicas return loading success, StarRocks returns loading task success. Otherwise, StarRocks returns loading task failed.
- `ONE`：When **one** of the data replicas returns loading success, StarRocks returns loading task success. Otherwise, StarRocks returns loading task failed.
- `ALL`：When **all** of the data replicas return loading success, StarRocks returns loading task success. Otherwise, StarRocks returns loading task failed.

> **CAUTION**
>
> - Setting a low write quorum for loading increases the risk of data inaccessibility and even loss. For example, you load data into a table with one write quorum in a StarRocks cluster of two replicas, and the data was successfully loaded into only one replica. Despite that StarRocks determines the loading task succeeded, there is only one surviving replica of the data. If the server which stores the tablets of loaded data goes down, the data in these tablets becomes inaccessible. And if the disk of the server is damaged, the data is lost.
> - StarRocks returns the loading task status only after all data replicas have returned the status. StarRocks will not return the loading task status when there are replicas whose loading status is unknown. In a replica, loading timeout is also considered as loading failed.

#### Specify data writing and replication mode among replicas

If your StarRocks cluster has multiple data replicas, you can specify the `single_leader_replication` parameter in `PROPERTIES` to configure the data writing and replication mode among replicas.

- `true` indicates that data is written only to the primary replica. Other replicas synchronize data from the primary replica. This mode reduces CPU cost caused by data writing to multiple replicas.
- `false` indicates "leaderless replication", which means data is directly written to multiple replicas, without differentiating primary and secondary replicas. The CPU cost is multiplied by the number of replicas.

2.4.0 and earlier versions only support "leaderless replication". 2.5.0 supports both "leaderless replication" and "single leader replication".

You can modify this parameter using ALTER TABLE. Example:

```sql
    ALTER TABLE <tbl_name>
    SET ("single_leader_replication" = "false");
```

#### Create rollup in bulk

You can create rollup in bulk when you create a table.

Syntax:

```SQL
ROLLUP (rollup_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...)
[FROM from_index_name]
[PROPERTIES ("key"="value", ...)],...)
```

## Examples

### Create an Aggregate Key table that uses Hash bucketing and column-based storage

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hash
(
    k1 TINYINT,
    k2 DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT "10.5",
    v1 CHAR(10) REPLACE,
    v2 INT SUM
)
ENGINE=olap
AGGREGATE KEY(k1, k2)
COMMENT "my first starrocks table"
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(k1) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES ("storage_type"="column");
```

### Create an Aggregate Key table and set the storage medium and cooldown time

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hash
(
    k1 BIGINT,
    k2 LARGEINT,
    v1 VARCHAR(2048) REPLACE,
    v2 SMALLINT SUM DEFAULT "10"
)
ENGINE=olap
UNIQUE KEY(k1, k2)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (k1, k2) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES(
    "storage_type"="column",
    "storage_medium" = "SSD",
    "storage_cooldown_time" = "2015-06-04 00:00:00"
);
```

Or

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hash
(
    k1 BIGINT,
    k2 LARGEINT,
    v1 VARCHAR(2048) REPLACE,
    v2 SMALLINT SUM DEFAULT "10"
)
ENGINE=olap
PRIMARY KEY(k1, k2)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (k1, k2) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES(
    "storage_type"="column",
    "storage_medium" = "SSD",
    "storage_cooldown_time" = "2015-06-04 00:00:00"
);
```

### Create a Duplicate Key table that uses Range partition, Hash bucketing，and column-based storage, and set the storage medium and cooldown time

LESS THAN

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.table_range
(
    k1 DATE,
    k2 INT,
    k3 SMALLINT,
    v1 VARCHAR(2048),
    v2 DATETIME DEFAULT "2014-02-04 15:36:00"
)
ENGINE=olap
DUPLICATE KEY(k1, k2, k3)
PARTITION BY RANGE (k1)
(
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-01-01"),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-06-01"),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-12-01")

PROPERTIES(
    "storage_medium" = "SSD", 
    "storage_cooldown_time" = "2015-06-04 00:00:00"
);
```

Note:

This statement will create three data partitions:

```SQL
( {    MIN     },   {"2014-01-01"} )
[ {"2014-01-01"},   {"2014-06-01"} )
[ {"2014-06-01"},   {"2014-12-01"} )
```

Data outside these ranges will be not be loaded.

Fixed Range

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_range

### Create a dynamic partition table

The dynamic partitioning function must be enabled ("dynamic_partition.enable" = "true") in FE configuration. For more information, see [Configure dynamic partitions](#configure-dynamic-partitions).

This example creates partitions for the next three days and deletes partitions created three days ago. For example, if today is 2020-01-08, partitions with the following names will be created: p20200108, p20200109, p20200110, p20200111, and their ranges are:

```Plain%20Text
[types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-08]; ‥types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-09]; )
[types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-09]; ‥types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-10]; )
[types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-10]; ‥types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-11]; )
[types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-11]; ‥types: [DATE]; keys: [2020-01-12]; )
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.dynamic_partition
(
    k1 DATE,
    k2 INT,
    k3 SMALLINT,
    v1 VARCHAR(2048),
    v2 DATETIME DEFAULT "2014-02-04 15:36:00"
)
ENGINE=olap
DUPLICATE KEY(k1, k2, k3)
PARTITION BY RANGE (k1)
(
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-01-01"),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-06-01"),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ("2014-12-01")
)
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(k2) BUCKETS 10
PROPERTIES(
    "storage_medium" = "SSD",
    "dynamic_partition.enable" = "true",
    "dynamic_partition.time_unit" = "DAY",
    "dynamic_partition.start" = "-3",
    "dynamic_partition.end" = "3",
    "dynamic_partition.prefix" = "p",
    "dynamic_partition.buckets" = "10"
);
```

### Create a Hive external table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hive
(
    k1 TINYINT,
    k2 VARCHAR(50),
    v INT
)
ENGINE=hive
PROPERTIES
(
    "resource" = "hive0",
    "database" = "hive_db_name",
    "table" = "hive_table_name"
);
```
