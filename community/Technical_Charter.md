**a Series of LF Projects, LLC**

**Adopted Feb. 14, 2023**

- -----

This charter (the "Charter") sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the StarRocks project, which has been established as StarRocks Project a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter.

### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project 

a. The mission of the Project is to build a new blazing-fast data platform to unify analytics on real-time and historical data, and empower everyone to easily and quickly gain insights on all data.

b. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open-source project.

### 2. Technical Steering Committee

a. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. 

b. The TSC will consist of two roles - TSC voting members and Committers.

c. The TSC voting members are the Project’s Maintainers. At the inception of the project, the Maintainers of the Project will be as set forth within the "CONTRIBUTING" file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. 

d. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors, Committers and Maintainers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: 

- Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; 

- Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository. A contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the voting members of the TSC; a Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the voting members of the TSC in accordance with Section 3 of this Charter.
- Maintainers are a subset of Committers with additional responsibilities for driving a project’s release and serving on the TSC. A Committer may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of the existing Maintainers in accordance with Section 3 of this Charter.

e. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor (and, if approved in accordance with the terms of this Charter, a Committer or Maintainer) is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. 

f. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

g. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.  The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and The Linux Foundation.

h. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
2. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
3. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
4. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
5. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;
6. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
7. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;
8. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and
9. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.

### 3. TSC Voting

a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

b. Votes shall be taken by the voting members of the TSC to determine whether an individual shall become or be removed as a Committer or Maintainer, provided that a vote to remove a Maintainer shall not count or require the vote of such Maintainer.

c. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

d. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.

e. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.

### 4. Compliance with Policies 

a. This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.  

b. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager.  In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.

c.

d. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests.

e. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all.
