/**
 * MVUnionRewriteMode is used to store union rewrite mode for materialized view union.
 * The mode is used to control the union rewrite behavior:
 *
 * <p>Default mode</p>
 * Query = MV + (Query - MV)
 * Query - MV = not(Query Based MV Rewrite Compensation)
 * eg:
 *  query   : select * from t where a > 10
 *  mv      : select * from t where a > 20
 *
 * Because MV = (Query) where a > 20
 * Query Based MV Rewrite Compensation: a > 20
 * Query - MV = not (Query Based MV Rewrite Compensation) and Query's predicates
 *            = not (a > 20) and a > 10
 *            = (a <= 20 or a is null) and a > 10
 *            = 10 < a <= 20
 *
 * Query = MV + (Query - MV)
 *       = MVBasedRewrite + QueryBasedRewrite(not mv to query compensation)
 *       = (select * from t where a > 10) union all (select * from t where 10 < a <= 20)
 *       = MV + (select * from t where 10 < a <= 20)
 *
 * <p>Pull Predicate V1 </p>
 * Default mode needs query can be used for rewrite for mv's define query which is not always satisfied.
 * But we can pull up some predicates to increase the ability of union rewrite.
 *
 * eg:
 * Query: select dt, k1, k2 from tblA where dt >= '2023-11-01' and k2 > 1
 *  MV  : select dt, k2 from tblA where dt = '2023-11-01'
 *
 * At default mode, query cannot be rewritten by mv's define query, but if we pull up some predicates to Query' and then
 * it will be rewritten for mv.
 *
 *  Query'      : select dt, k1, k2 from tblA where dt >= '2023-11-01
 *  MV          : select dt, k2 from tblA where dt = '2023-11-01'
 *  PullUp Query: Query' where k2 > 1
 *
 * So Query' can be rewritten by mv's define query, only need add extra predicates after rewrite.
 *
 * <p>Pull Predicate V2 </p>
 * Pull Predicate V1 only pull predicates that are not contained in MV's define query, but v2 can pull up all predicates
 * Query: select dt, k2 from tblA where date_trunc('day', dt) >= '2023-11-01'
 * Mv   : select dt, k2 from tblA where dt = '2023-11-01'
 *
 * Query'       :  select dt, k2 from tblA
 * Pull up Query: Query' where date_trunc('day', dt) >= '2023-11-01'
 *
 *<p> Transparent Union Rewrite </p>
 * If predicates are partition predicates(eg, query refreshed partitions and to-refresh partitions), we can use treat mv as a
 * transparent table(freshness is always satisfied) and rewrite by union all.
 *
 * MV   : select * from t, but only refreshed partitions(dt = '2023-11-01')
 * Query: select col1, col2 from t where dt in ('2023-11-01', '2023-11-02')
 *
 * In this case we can not use other modes to rewrite, since query cannot be rewritten by mv's define query(query only selects
 * partial columns and mv's partial refreshed).
 *
 * If we treat mv as complete refreshed, we can rewrite it.
 *
 * Transparent MV: select * from t(all partition refreshed) union all select * from mv's defined query(all to-refresh partitions)
 *
 * Query            : select col1, col2 from t where dt in ('2023-11-01', '2023-11-02')
 * Query Rewritten  : select col1, col2 from <Transparent MV> where dt in ('2023-11-01', '2023-11-02')
 * Transparent MV   : Refreshed MV Partitions union all To-Refresh MV Partitions
 *                = select * from mv where dt = '2023-11-01' union all select * from t where dt = '2023-11-02';
 *
 * so the final Query Rewritten:
 * Query Rewritten: select col1, col2 from <Transparent MV> where dt in ('2023-11-01', '2023-11-02')
 *  = select col1, col2 from (select * from mv where dt = '2023-11-01' union all select * from t where dt = '2023-11-02')
 *      where dt in ('2023-11-01', '2023-11-02')
 *  = select col1, col2 from mv where dt = '2023-11-01' union all select col1, col2 from t where dt = '2023-11-02'
 *
 * <p>Enum</p>
 *  default: default mode, only try to union all rewrite by logical plan tree after partition compensate
 *  1: pull predicate v1, try to pull up query's filter after union when query's output matches mv's define query
 *      which will increase union rewrite's ability, and then use query to rewrite mv's define query.
 *  2: pull predicate v2, try to pull up query's filter after union as much as possible.
 *  3: transparent union all rewrite, treat mv as a transparent table(freshness is always satisfied) and rewrite by union all.
