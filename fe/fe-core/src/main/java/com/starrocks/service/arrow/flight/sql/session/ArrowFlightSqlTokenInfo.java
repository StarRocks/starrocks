/**
 * Represents a token and its associated user identity for an Arrow Flight SQL session.
 * <p>
 * This class is used to store and retrieve session-related information in the Arrow Flight SQL
 * token cache. Each token is associated with a specific user and is used to authenticate
 * and manage the session lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * The token is a unique identifier (UUID) generated at session initialization and is used
 * to retrieve the session context. The session is considered valid as long as the token
 * is present in the cache and not expired or evicted.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Created during session initialization in {@link ArrowFlightSqlSessionManager}.</li>
 *   <li>Stored in a Guava {@code LoadingCache} with a configurable expiration time.</li>
 *   <li>Used to retrieve the {@code UserIdentity} and token string for session validation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Invalid Token</h2>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #createInvalidTokenInfo()} method returns a special instance with {@code null} values,
 * used as a fallback in the cache loader. This instance should not be used for valid session operations.
 *
