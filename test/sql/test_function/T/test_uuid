-- name: test_uuid
-- description: Test uuid() function, especially comparisons that previously caused deadlocks

-- Test basic uuid() call
select uuid() is not null;

-- Test uuid() != uuid() - this previously caused a deadlock
select uuid() != uuid();

-- Test uuid() = uuid() 
select uuid() = uuid();

-- Test uuid() in a more complex expression
select length(uuid()) > 0;

-- Test uuid() in comparison with itself shouldn't be folded
select case when uuid() = uuid() then 1 else 0 end;

-- Test multiple uuid() calls in different positions
select uuid() is not null, uuid() is not null;
