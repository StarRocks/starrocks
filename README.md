Docs repository

## Tips

- Images should be put into `./assets`, and used like: `![test image](../../assets/test.png)` or `![test image](/assets/test.png)`
- All markdown files are indexed in `TOC.md`which is used to render the sidebar of the website. `File links in the TOC.md should be absolute path.`
- Code blocks writen with no language specified are forbiddened.
- Docs that need to be used as `help xxx` in DorisDB should be put into `./sql-referernce`.
- No special charactors allowed in markdown filesã€‚
