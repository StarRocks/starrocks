description: Propose verified fixes for documentation SQL examples that fail the doc-rot checker (docs/scripts/run_sql_samples.py). Classifies each FAILing example, and only for genuinely fixable ones proposes a corrected statement, verifies it against a live cluster via the StarRocks MCP server, and opens a DRAFT [Doc] PR. Use after run_sql_samples.py produces a FAIL list. Never auto-merges.

# SQL doc auto-fix

Turn the checker's **detect** output into **suggested fixes**, safely. Golden rule:
**"executes" ≠ "correct documentation."** Making a statement run by changing what
it teaches is worse than leaving it broken. Classify first; only rewrite the
genuinely fixable; flag the rest. English docs only — never edit `docs/zh/**` or
`docs/ja/**`.

## Prerequisites
- The **`starrocks` MCP server** is attached (see repo-root `.mcp.json`; tools:
  `read_query`, `write_query`, `table_overview`, `db_overview`), pointed at the
  running cluster the docs were tested against.
- A cluster of the version under test is up:
  `SR_VERSION=<v> docker compose -f docs/docker/doc-verification/docker-compose-shared-nothing.yml up -d --wait`.
- A checkout of the docs at the matching release branch (e.g. `branch-4.1`).

## Step 0 — Build the candidate list
```
python3 docs/scripts/run_sql_samples.py --docs-root <release-checkout>/docs/en/sql-reference \
    --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9030 --user root --format json > /tmp/run.json
python3 docs/scripts/autofix_candidates.py --run-json /tmp/run.json \
    --repo <release-checkout> --limit 20 > /tmp/candidates.json
```
Check the `meta` block: if docs and cluster versions are **not aligned**, stop —
misaligned failures are not doc rot.

## Step 1 — Classify each candidate (the guardrail)
Read `doc_context` to understand what the example *teaches*, use the MCP server to
check reality, then assign exactly one class:
- **fixable** — renamed/removed function, reserved word as identifier
  (`FROM order`, `CREATE INDEX index`), clear syntax slip. Confirm the intended
  feature exists (`read_query` on `information_schema`, `SHOW FUNCTIONS`,
  `table_overview`). → propose a fix (Step 2).
- **version/build-gated** — the function/config/keyword isn't in this build
  (verify it's absent). Docs may be correct for a newer release. → **do not
  rewrite**; recommend a "Since vX.Y" note.
- **needs-setup** — references objects an isolated run can't have; fix only if
  making it self-contained is trivial and preserves intent, else flag.
- **illustrative** — synopsis, cross-dialect comparison, client transcript. → leave.
- **unsure** → flag for a human.

## Step 2 — Propose + verify (fixable only)
Work in an isolated scratch database via the MCP server:
```
write_query: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS docfix_scratch;
write_query: USE docfix_scratch;   -- do ALL test writes here
```
- Create only the minimal setup the example implies. Run the candidate fix; on
  error, read the error + `table_overview` and refine — **max 3 attempts**.
- **Preserve intent:** the fix must still demonstrate the same point. If the only
  way to make it run changes what it teaches, it is NOT fixable — reclassify.
- On success record `file`, `line`, `before`, `after`, verified statement; then
  `write_query: DROP DATABASE docfix_scratch;`.

## Step 3 — Assemble a DRAFT PR
- Branch off `origin/main` in a git worktree (docs fixes target `main`, then
  backport). Confirm each example exists on `main` before editing.
- Apply each verified edit to its source `.md`/`.mdx`.
- Open a **draft** `[Doc]` PR whose body has (1) **Fixes** — `file:line`,
  before → after, "verified: runs on `<cluster version>`"; (2) **Not fixed (for
  review)** — version-gated / needs-setup / illustrative, each with its
  classification and recommendation.
- Leave it a draft. A human reviews and un-drafts.

## Never
- Never un-draft or merge; never commit without operator review.
- Never run `write_query` outside the scratch DB; never account/role, cluster
  (`ALTER SYSTEM`), `DROP` on real databases, backup/restore, or file/routine-load
  statements during verification.
- Never rewrite an example to "make it pass" at the cost of what it teaches.
- Never treat a version/build-gated failure as doc rot.
